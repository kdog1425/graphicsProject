 Age of Context Mobile Sensors Data and the Future of Privacy

 Robert Scoble and Shel Israel
 Foreword

 Just a few months ago I was headed out to a conference on the East Coast and tweeted from the plane tweeted from the plane mind you Cant wait to get to Boston Staying at the X hotel Hope to have dinner at Rialto and see the Sox play tomorrow 
 A few hours later I walked into the hotel and was exuberantly greeted Welcome Mr Benioff were so glad you are here We saw your tweet The restaurant you wanted to try We have a table for you And the tickets for tomorrows game They are on your nightstand ready for you
 Wow Amazing Dream travel experience right 
 Yes alas it was just a dream That is not what happened in the Boston hotel Not at all Instead I checked in and they said Here are your keys 
 But it could have happened And it should have happened I cant even name the hotel because its so embarrassing that they did not do this But how phenomenal of a story would it have been if they did
 Technology has unlocked incredible new ways for companies to connect with customers The fact is we have more data and more insight about the customer than ever before and customers expect companies to use it Now companies cannot proceed with business as usual They need to change and advance to meet the rising expectations of modern customers 
 Today we are in the midst of a customer revolution where the world is being reshaped by the convergence of social and mobile cloud technologies The combination of these technologies enables us to connect everything together in a new way and is dramatically transforming the way we live and work 
 Now cloud computing over powerful LTE wireless networks is delivering on the promise of billions of computers interconnecting Not just the mobile phones in our pockets but different kinds of computersour watches our cameras our cars our refrigerators our toothbrushes Every aspect of our lives is somehow on the network a wireless network and in the cloud This is the third wave of computing
 Research firm IDC reports that there will be 35 billion networked products by 2015 Compare that to 17 billion networked PCs and its clear that the Internet of Things has arrived With it and with everything connected to the network we enter an amazing new world of possibilities 
 The big change here is that technology is becoming intuitive It is starting to understand where you are and where you are likely to be going and it can help you on your way Connected technologies make your customers happier and accordingly your revenues bigger
 In the connected world customers are no longer just a number or account they are unique human beings with a distinct set of needs They have a powerful voice that they know how to use They want a relationship on equal terms and they expect to be at the center of your world Companies must listen and engage and earn their trust every day 
 Thats why innovative companies are connecting employees partners and products in new ways to align around customers like never before I see our customers transforming into customer companies by building connected products that can communicate status updates reports and other information in real time Philips a visionary consumercentric company is using technology to deliver innovations that matter to its customers It uses our software to connect millions of productsfrom toothbrushes and coffeemakers to new LED lighting productsonto a single customer network Im looking forward to the connected next gen toothbrush that will send a report to my dentist
 Toyota is using our software to connect dealers customers cars and devices It is already building connections with customers into the more than 8 million cars it manufactures each year Cars now have the capability to tweet status updates to their drivers They can anticipate your actions so they can provide the service information that you need Shigeki Tomoyama managing officer at Toyota calls it a new kind of car almost like an iPhone on wheels 
 GE is another leading example GE Aviation is building closer connections to its customersand making its products more socially connected The new GEnx jet enginecurrently flying on Boeings new 787 Dreamlinercan provide newsfeeds that can be accessed by service teams on their mobile devices to ultimately help reduce maintenance costs and increase engine lifespan
 The big question is how we will adapt to keep up with these changes The Age of Context helps show us the way The book examines five technology forces mobile social media big data sensors and locationbased technologies It reports on sensors being installed everywhere from neighboring planets to traffic signals and even in our workout shoes and toasters It demonstrates how to leverage Big Data and highspeed highscale cloud databases that allow nearinstant analysis of terabytes of data It reveals the nextgeneration mobile apps which are customized and can anticipate what you want and need It examines mature social media highly personalized networks that will understand what you want in the context of where you are and what you are doing It shows advances in wearable computers that not only add a handsfree ability but that can become our assistants or coaches 
 Technology always moves aheadand this is the next evolution And like any evolution adapting is what enables us to survive and thrive in an alwayschanging world This book which is written with inspiration and hope shows how this new age will be good for us and for our health for the education of our kids and for our businesses It shows us how it will make our lives better 
 Be prepared to see the future in these pages glass in homes and skyscrapers that adjusts to mood and weather conditions and lets airplane pilots see through fogall because the glass understands the context of its environment Youll read about mobile apps that know your calendar and whats at the dry cleaners so it can help you pick what to wear In the notsodistant future we will have prosthetic devices sensitive to touch connected to human nerves and operating from brain commands There will be exoskeletons that empower paraplegics to walk without assistance It is truly a brave new world
 I have been in the tech industry for 35 years and what I love about it the most is that the only constant is change We are now in the most transformative time of our industry Veteran tech journalists Robert Scoble and Shel Israel walk us through these changes with compelling stories and insightful explanations They have written an important book with the Age of Context They see whats coming and reveal a very exciting picture of the futureand get us ready which is critical because its already here

 Introduction Storms Coming

 Computing is not about computers any more It is about living

 Nicholas Negroponte cofounder MIT Media Labs 

 A storm of change is coming
 In the 2005 movieBatman Beginsthe capedguy appears out of nowhere to deliver a cryptic message to Commissioner Gordon about the shortterm future of Gotham City Storms cominghe warns and just as suddenly as he appears he is gone
 For the next two hours of the movie all hell breaks loose Finally peace is restored When people resume their normal lives after so much tumult and trouble they discover life after the storm is better than it was before 
 Change is inevitable and the disruption it causes often brings both inconvenience and opportunity The recent history of technology certainly proves that In the pages that follow we describe contextual computing the latest development in the evolution of technological change and discuss how it will affect nearly all aspects of your life and work
 We are not caped crusaders but we are here to prepare you for an imminent storm Tumult and disruption will be followed by improvements in health safety convenience and efficiency 
 Who Are These Guys


 We are two veteran Silicon Valley journalists covering two interdependent communities technology and business Weve been hanging out in tech circles for most of our professional lives and have spent many many hours interviewing tech newsmakers 
 Robert Scoble has become one of the worlds bestknown and most respected reporters of tech innovation Shel Israelhas provided reports and analysis for private business and as a freelancer for BusinessWeek Fast Company Dow Jones Publishing and currently Forbescom
 A quick aside about voice We occasionally discuss each other in the third person Its the simplest way we know to maintain clarity when two of us are writing
 This is our fourth collaboration Our biggest previous success was a book calledNaked Conversations How Blogs are Changing the Way Businesses Talk with Customers which came out in the first week of 2006Naked Conversationsconcluded by declaring that what we now call social media was bringing the world into a new age one we called the Age of Conversation a term that has endured so far 
 As common as the topic of context has become in Scobles technologycentric world Israel has heard very little mention of it in business circles Most businesspeople are still trying to push rocks uphill toward business recovery 
 However history indicates that when the tech community is unified focused and excited about a topic as it is about context it almost always follows that they will make waves that land on the shores of commerce Although this book introduces some thought leaders the business community overall is not thinking much about context right now But they will soon be productizing it and using it for competitive advantage
 Context Through Google Glass


 Google Glass is the product that is raising public awareness excitement and concerns about contextual computing This wearable device is discussed in depth in Chapter 2 It is like nothing that has previously existed containing sensors a camera a microphone and a prism for projecting information in front of your eyes It has more computing power than the 1976 Cray1 supercomputer that cost 88 million It weighs a mere 49 grams and serves as a highly personalized assistant that accompanies you through your daily life 
 A simple example is how Glass displays your specific flight information as you walk into the airline terminal It can do that because the system knows your location and your calendar and can sense where youre looking The more it knows about you and your activity patterns the better it can serve your current needsand even predict what you might want next 
 Thad Starner a technical leadmanager on Googles Glass team and associate professor of computing at Georgia Tech is a trailblazer in wearable contextual technology As he explains on his Google page For over 20 years I have worn a computer in my everyday life as an intelligent assistant the longest such experience known He also coined the term augmented reality to describe the assistive experience 
 In 1991 Starners doctoral thesis mentioned that onbody systems can sense the users context A little more than 20 years later the necessary technologies have caught up with his prediction 
 As we started investigating contextual technologies we quickly saw implications going far beyond this wellpublicized digital eyewear In 2012 we watched all sorts of wearable technologies migrate from RD labs into a wide variety of products and services We found a great many promising entrepreneurs who were selling or planning innovative products for retail transportation government medicine and home use that were all built on the premise of serving users better by knowing more about them and their environments
 Contextual Building Blocks 


 InThe Perfect Stormauthor SebastianJunger described a rare but fierce weather phenomenon caused by the convergence of three meteorological forces warm air cool air and tropical moisture Such natural occurrences cause 100foot waves 100mph winds andat least until recentlyoccur about once every 50 to 100 years 
 Our perfect storm is composed not of three forces but five and they are technological rather than meteorological mobile devices social media big data sensors and locationbased services Youll learn more about them in Chapter 1 and how theyre already causing disruption and making waves As discrete entities each force is already part of your life Together they have created the conditions for an unstoppable perfect storm of epic proportion the Age of Context
 Those forces are made possible by the maturation of some enabling technologies Up to this point computers either filled a room or sat on a table Today miniaturization resulting from silicon engineering has enabled the power of a supercomputer to fit in a wearable or mobile device Previously computers didnt know anything about you or your contextnot where you were whom you were with or what you were doing Today the Age of Context brings a new kind of mobile or wearable computer that can wirelessly interact with dozens if not hundreds of sensors on or around you This device also has access to all of humankinds collected knowledge
 Through the use of many different types of sensors our mobile devices now emulate three of our five senses Camera sensors give them eyes and microphone sensors serve as ears capacitive sensors enable them to feel our touch on their screens They cant yet detect fragrancebut our guess is that such a capability is coming soon
 The socalled Internet of Things enables many common appliances fixtures and devices to communicate with systems due to the availability of radical new lowcost and miniaturized sensors Microsoft Kinect for Xbox for example has a 3D sensor that can see your heartbeat just by looking at your skin
 When we talk about the system knowing about you that knowledge depends on machine learning and database computation breakthroughs that couldnt be imagined when Microsoft researcher Jim Gray turned on Microsofts first terabyte database back in December 1997 Similarly significant innovations and accuracy improvements in voice recognition make systems like Apples Siri Google Now and Google Voice Search possible 
 The foundation for the Age of Contextall of these technologies working togetheris the cloud computing infrastructure which continues to grow exponentially in capability and capacity And it had better keep growing A selfdriving car which we describe in Chapter 5 generates about 700 megabytes of data per second We talked with GM Ford Toyotaand Googleabout what would happen if every car had that technology Well for one thing todays cloud computing technology would melt down
 Rackspace a cloud hosting provider and Scobles employer was the first and largest sponsor of this book Since 2009 it has funded Scoble to travel the world interviewing hundreds of entrepreneurs and innovators One reason for such support is that it had also seen an increase in resourceintensive services and data flows 
 By coincidence Rackspace also provides the infrastructure for many of the companies we discuss in this book Years before we teamed up for this book Rackspace was exploring potentially worldchanging or disruptive trends In response to those trends it built a new hybrid cloud to enable companies to scale and address new privacy concerns it realized the new contextual technologies would bring 
 Rackspace asked Scoble its publicfacing point person to independently dig into this new pattern and figure out what was going on Thus began the 18month journey that culminated in the publication of this book So we appreciate Rackspace for its support and its insights
 The Tradeoff


 Some of the technology youll read about can be a bit discomforting Cars without drivers Calendars that send messages on your behalf Front doors that unlock and open when they see you approach But those issues are fairly straightforward people will either embrace the new technology or they wont 
 The larger looming issue is the very real loss of personal privacy and the lack of transparency about how it happens The marvels of the contextual age are based on a tradeoff the more the technology knows about you the more benefits you will receive That can leave you with the chilling sensation that big data is watching you In the vast majority of cases we believe the coming benefits are worth that tradeoff Whether or not you come to the same conclusion we all will need to understand the multiple issues that will be impacting the future of privacy 
 Weather the Storm


 All indications are that thechanges ushered in by the Age of Context will be more significant and fundamental than what has occurred in the previous era and they are likely to occur faster We hope you can use this book as a framework to understand the contextual developments that will take place over the next few years We hope you take it in context and that it will help you adjust to the changes in your work and your life 
 We also hope you will find the book fun to read We tell you many stories about amazing people and uncanny technology We hope to convince you that embracing contextual technology is very much in your interest Above all we hope to prepare you so you can survive and thrive through the coming titanic storm 
 

 Chapter 1


 The Five Forces

 The force is an energy field created by all living things It surrounds us and penetrates us It binds the galaxy together

 ObiWan Kenobi Star Wars

 Theyre everywhere The five forces of context are at your fingertips when you touch a screen They know where you are and in what direction you are headed when you carry a smartphone They are in your car to warn you when you are too close to something else They are in traffic lights stores and even pills 
 The five forces are changing your experience as a shopper a customer a patient a viewer or an online traveler They are also changing businesses of all sizes 
 All five of these forcesmobile social media data sensors and locationare enjoying an economic sweet spot They are in a virtuous cycle Rapid adoption is driving prices down which in turn drives more adoption which completes the cycle by driving prices down further
 This means these five forces are in the hands of more people every day and it means almost every business will have to adjust course to include context in their strategies just as they had to do at the advent of other forces of dramatic change like personal computing or the web 
 Forwardthinking business leaders and tech evangelists are already using these forces to prosper while simultaneously making their customers and followers happier and technologists are coming up with new contextual tools toys and services at a breathtaking speed
 We told you a little bit about each of these five forces in our introduction and you are already familiar with most or all of them but lets drill a little deeper to help you understand why each is so powerful 
 Mobile


 Sometime in 2012 the number of cellphones on Earth surpassed the number of people By the end of the year we had 120 million tablet computers and Gartner Group a market analyst predicted the number would grow to 665 million by 2016
 Whether or not these forecasts come close doesnt really matter The point is there are going to be a whole lot of mobile devices around and by simple arithmetic most people in the developed world will be carrying around more than one of them at any given time
 Mobile is taking new formsYouve already heard much about Google Glass but a lot more is going on in wearables than the new digital eyewear Despite how new and different these products may seem people are adopting them faster than many prognosticators anticipated
  Tech analyst Juniper Research estimates wearable computing will generate 800 million in revenue in 2013 rising to 15 billion in 2014 Annual unit sales of wearables will rise from 15 million in 2013 to 70 million by 2017 Personally we think those numbers are very low but we shall see
 Wearables are already in use for recreation personal and business productivity meeting new people improving safety fitness and health We think wearables will be used in a great many more ways some of which are yet to be imagined
 The mobile device often overlooked these days is the laptopLaptops gave people an appreciation even a hunger for mobility They untethered us from the desktop but they really arent contextual machines They dont have sensors and they dont have operating systems that can run the mobile apps essential to context These days laptops feel heavy and awkward compared with other mobile options In fact laptops have become the new desktops Most are left at home or in the office as we move around with more agile and contextual tools 
 And costs are coming down primarily because theres lots of competitionEven the barriers presented by expensive data plans are eroding because of challenges from upstart companies like Macheen and ItsOn and most recently industry giants TMobile and Sprint
 The smartphone is now the primary device for most peoplethe one they live on and use most of the time This has been made possible of course by the great migration of data from our individual computers into the cloud and it is now being strengthened by its accommodation of contextual applications
 We believe despite innovations in nextgeneration laptops as well as the incredible handsfree capabilities of wearables that for at least the next five to ten years the smartphone will be the wireless device of choice for most of the worlds users 
 We also believe that in both phones and tablets the brand and the operating systems consumers choose are starting to matter less The hardware forms from multiple suppliers are beginning to resemble each other and the devices perform extremely similar functions This may be bad for the makers but it is good for us users 
 People will use such devices more as they become lowcost commodities This means the streams of data being uploaded and the amount of content being consumed by these devices will increase exponentially 
 The real mobile news is not in the devices themselves but in how software has changed A little over a decade ago software was primarily loaded onto our desktop computers by inserting discs Priceperuser was often well over 100 and occasionally exceeded 1000
 Todays software is small inexpensive or free It takes about 30 seconds to start using a mobile app The average user downloads scores of them 
 The New York Times estimated that the 100000plus worldwide mobile app publishers offered more than 12 million mobile apps by the end of 2011 According to Gartner apps were downloaded over 45 billion times by the end of 2012more than six apps for every man woman and child on Earth and that number is continuously growing
 Mobile is the aggregator of our other four forces Its where they all converge Your device is your key to all the power of the internet It is where the superstorm of context thunders into your life
 Social Media


 In 2005 when we were researching Naked Conversations fewer than 4 million people were using blogs wikis and podcasts The terms social media and social networks did not yet exist Facebook had started but at the time we dismissed it as an irrelevant niche service for Ivy League frat boys seeking dates Twitter hadnt even been born 
 Fastforward to the beginning of 2013 when a billion tweets were posted every 48 to 72 hours and growth was exponential Today nearly 15 billion people are on social networks Almost no successful modern business deploys a goforward strategy that does not include social media Almost every mobile app we mention in this book contains a social media component
 When organizations use social media wisely companies and customers come closer together Employees and users often collaborate on making products and services better 
 Although most of us dont yet feel all warm and fuzzy about the modern enterprise social media has empowered some of these gargantuan entities to present a more human face Weve come to recognize that behind the corporate curtain that displays a brand logo real people are very often trying to serve customers better 
 Smart companies have come to understand that social media enables them to cut costs and improve marketing research product development recruiting communications and support
 However social media can also be abused and misused Instead of using it to engage customers and prospects some companies use it to shovel out marketing messages This may seem effective in the short term but in the long run it is usually a mistake Social media is a twoway channel and if you just send messages out its like using a phone only to talk not listen
 What has changed in the seven years since we proclaimed its arrival in Naked Conversations is that social media is no longer a disruptive force Instead it is a vital business component Rather than being resisted social media is now being woven into the very fabric of business 
 Social media is essential to the new Age of Context It is in our online conversations that we make it clear what we like where we are and what we are looking for As social media integrates with mobile data sensors and locationbased technologies it serves as a fount of highly personalized content and that content allows technology to understand the context of who you are what you are doing and what you are likely to do next
 Data


 We hear a great deal about data these days A lot of it is about danger and size Ironically just about everything we enjoy and need online comes to us from data It is the oxygen of the Age of Context It is everywhere and it is essential 
 Data is often referred to as big data because the amount that has been accumulated is so vast Describing it in quantifiable terms is like trying to measure the universe or calculate how many angels can dance on a Pinterest pinhead 
 Data is how we measure the internet Back in 2005 Eric Schmidt then CEO of Google estimated the size of the internet at roughly 5 million terabytes Today thats small potatoes Every day we expand the internet by half the size it was in 2005and it continues to expand at an exponential rate
 IBM estimates that 90 percent of the worlds data was created in the last two years As coauthors Rick Smolan and Jennifer Erwitt stated in their exquisite photo book The Human Face of Big Data Now in the first day of a babys life today the world creates 70 times the data contained in the entire Library of Congress
 This means that every day of your life more data is being uploaded than was created throughout all recorded history until just a couple of years ago
 So theres lots of focus on the big aspect of data It sometimes gives us the image of truckloads of data being heaped upon existing truckloads somewhere up in the cloud creating a virtual mountain so immense it makes Everest look like a molehill
 In our opinion the focus is on the wrong element Its not the big data mountain that matters so much to people its those tiny little spoonfuls we extract whenever we search chat view listen buyor do anything else online The hugeness can intimidate but the little pieces make us smarter and enable us to keep up with and make sense of an accelerating world 
 We call this the miracle of little data 
 In a couple of seconds and on a single try we find precisely the three tweets we are searching for They are extracted from billions that we dont want and dont receive Instagram can display exactly where you were on the planet when you clicked that cute shot of your puppy and not show you all the other places where other puppies were photographed 
 You dont need to be a technologist to understand there is something amazing in our ability to find precisely the data we wantand only the data we wantin a song email or restaurant review Its like finding a diamond in a coalmineevery time we searchwithout dirtying ourselves in the coal
 We accomplish this because computers have developed the ability to recognize patterns in data streams and extract data based on whos asking for it It is a complicated process that happens usually in less than two seconds and most of us dont fully understand how it works The miracle is that you can enjoy the results and even take them for granted All you need to know is how to work a few simple apps on your mobile phone
 Until recently only the wealthiest and most powerful organizations could extract data effectively from databases First a computer professional who could speak the language of a database software program had to put the data into a structure that the machine could understand and then know how to retrieve it later It was hard and those of us who had to use such structured databases found them cumbersome and slow to produce results that mattered
 Most of us are a much messier lot when it comes to data We generally prefer PostIt notes to some arcane language called SQL or DB2 We have created a messy internet filled with text sites and posts that do not adhere to database language structures and therefore can not be found in structured databases 
 When data started coming at a daily rate of 70 times the contents of the Library of Congress programmers simply could not keep structuring and entering it anywhere near the speed at which people produced it So nextgeneration companies like Google started building networks of gigantic data centers that employed millions of computers to host all the data being produced 
 Storing this data was the smaller of two challenges The bigger one was figuring out how everyday people could extract the little spoonfuls they wanted from inside the new unstructured big data mountains 
 Google again led the way Until 2012 the essence of its data search engine was Page Rank which used complex mathematical equations or algorithms to understand connections between web pages and then rank them by relevance in search results
 Before Google we got back haystacks when we searched for needles Then we had to sift through pages and pages of possible answers to find the one right for us Page Rank started to understand the rudimentary context of a search It could tell by your inquiry pattern that when you searched for park in San Francisco you wanted greenery and not some place to leave your car 
 Essentially Google reversed the data equation Instead of you learning to speak in a machine language Google started to make machines recognize your natural language This has made all the difference in the world
 When Facebook rapidly evolved into the worlds biggest site it made a series of forward leaps related to searching First it came up with the social graph which examines relationships between people instead of data It extrapolated relevant data by examining graphical representations rather than strings of text 
 Next Facebook created a Graph API Application Programming Interface that enabled thirdparty developers to connect and share data with the Facebook platform using common verbs such as read listen to like comment on and so forth
 More recentlyand significantlyFacebook introduced Graph Search which might well evolve into the first significant challenge to Googles search engine dominance Instead of using keyword searches to find pages such as Boston  lobster restaurants Graph Search allows users to use natural language to ask questions such as Restaurants nearby that my friends like Then instead of having a spider crawl pages of data on the web it finds relevant content in conversations your friends have had
 Graph Search provides faster easier and more contextually relevant results because the Facebook technology is able to extract most of what you hope to find Google uses links to decide relevancy Facebook uses your friends and an understanding of your social behavior 
 Thats a sizeable shift and one that will be important as we head into the Age of Context And Facebook isnt alone In our research on data we found dozens of new companies using new methods to extract unstructured data All were open source companies whose founders seem more intent on empowering the masses than they are in helping big companies aggregate dirt on their customers or push ads into their faces Many are using graphs instead of tables to get better results outside the walls of the Facebook garden
 One such company is Neo Technology of San Mateo California Founder Emil Eifrem explained to us the importance of graphical versus textbased searches as a modern confirmation of the old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words
 Database technology is evolving beyond graphs A company called aione inc is making progress on biologically inspired intelligent agents that will deliver results by searching for ideas instead of merely keywords In short their technology builds tools that emulate the way the human brain works Essentially humans recognize patternssometimes highly complex ones We can detect the fundamental features and meaning of text time and visual data key components of context
 Pattern recognition which started just a few years ago is now reaching the state where database search tools are starting to think like people think They dont yet do it as effectively as we humans do it but they do it faster and far more efficiently
 There is a dark side to these growing capabilities We should watch for the unintended consequences that always seem to accompany significant change The potential for data abuse and the loss of privacy head the list of concerns Eli Pariser wrote a passionate and sincere argument about the loss of privacy in his 2011 book The Filter Bubble
 Pariser took a dark view of the fact that virtually every online site collects shares and sells user data He talked about how large organizations use data to stereotype people and then assume they know what we want to see and hear By getting our eyeballs to stick to their web pages they then get us to click on ads they target at us
 The book gave the impression that through data big organizations are watching us in a very Orwellian way It raised concerns about identity theft and loss of privacy and created a fear that big companies will control what we see Pariser scared the hell out of a lot of people who were already unsettled about this topic 
 He served as the prosecutor making the case against big data and he made a good case In fact there is truth to what he had to say and people should consider Parisers perspective as they make their own decisions about what to do and not do in the Age of Context
 In our view though Pariser presented a onesided perspective on a multisided and highly granular issue The Filter Bubble overlooked the worldimproving changes that big data is making
 As Neos Eifrem sees it Fundamentally companies like Neo build hammers You can use them to build or to smash Yes there will be abuses and we must be vigilant about that but the best solution to empowering people to find and learn what they need is contained in the new databases Big data allows everyone to easily get better results for what they are looking for through personalization of search results
 We share Eifrems perspective If Pariser is the prosecutor then perhaps you should regard us as big datas defense team Sometimes abusers will do horrible things with data they stole bought or otherwise obtained But percentage wise most data helps you and most companies use it in reputable ways usually to serve customers better 
 Unquestionably the genie has long since left the bottle As Pariser points out nearly every site collects data If you use the internet at all data is being collected on you Some people may choose to opt out of the internet for this reason but if you do that you are opting out of modern times
 Or you can limit your depth of involvement Many people use Facebook just to talk with people they already know and perhaps find a few longlost friends sharing comments with a handful of acquaintances Shel Israels wife Paula is among them She is quite happy with her limited use of the platform Despite her recognition of the imminent Age of Context she values her privacy enough to opt out of a number of social media options
 Conversely Robert Scoble spends many of his waking hours on Facebook He shares nearly everything about his life online He is so transparent that he sometimes makes Israel nervous But his Facebook presence has made him among the worlds bestknown technology innovators and that has very favorably impacted his professional life 
 More than a million people follow Scoble on his social networks Some become news sources for his Rackspace video work He gets invited to events all over the world Scoble believes that the more he tells Facebook and other online sites the more valuable his online experience will be
 Shel Israel and most people fall somewhere in between Scoble and Paula Israel Perhaps you should have the right to opt in before companies start taking and sharing our data but like Paula Israel you do have the ability to opt out When you do sites will know less about you and you need to expect you will get less from them Over time there is the very real possibility you will be left behind
 Sensors


 Sensors are simple little things that measure and report on change and in so doing they emulate the five human senses They are being attached to all sorts of living and inert objects so they can share what they observe Because sensors seem to be watching and listening to you as well as understanding what you are doing they like big data sometimes freak people out
 Sensors go back a very long way In the mid1600sEvangelista Torricellian Italian physicist invented a way to measure atmospheric pressure by using mercury in a vacuum tube called aTorricellian Tube Most people know it as abarometer
 Sensors full capability began about 50 years ago when factory automation started to come into play Unlike people sensors work tirelessly never needing sleep and never demanding a raise They notice changes where humans miss them thus ensuring labels are correctly affixed to bottles moving through a factory assembly lineThey are used in nuclear power plants for early detection of leaks
 Some semiconductor foundries such as TSMC in Taiwan are attempting to build whats known aslightsout factorieswhere sensors will eliminate the need for any employees at all Unconfirmed reports indicate they are coming close
 By the early 1990s sensors had become so inexpensive and so collectively powerful when used in networks that engineers were starting to believe the number of ways and places they could be useful was almost limitless
 By 2001 the conversation started to expand into what could happen when sensors were used to communicate over the webKevin Ashton an MIT technology pioneer developed the concept of inanimate objects talking with peopleand with each otherover the internet in global mesh networks He called this theInternet of Things and that vision is now reality Half of the conversations on the internet involve sensorenabled machines that more often than not talk with other machines
 Sensors exist everywhere on Earth as well as above and below itInstead of killing canaries in mines we now use sensors to detect problems and alert people They enable the Marsrover Curiosity to search for water and life and report what they find to people on Earth Jet engines on commercial planes talk in a social network with technicians to increase fuel economy
 Sensors keep health officials informed if you are epileptic have heart problems or suffer from vertigo The FDA has approved a digestible sensor embedded in a pill After you swallow the sensor reports data to technicians hopefully soon sensors will eliminate many invasive tests Sensors are being used in robots to make them behave in ways that are incredibly humanlike
 The watershed moment when sensors became a contextual force took place in January 2007 when Steve Jobsintroduced the iPhone This was the first successful mobile device to sport a touch screenmade possible through a tiny sensor in the glass The phone included other sensors that let you flip from horizontal to vertical view find Wifi and connect to a Bluetooth listening device An accelerometer sensor even enabled the phone to protect itself if you dropped it
 Today smartphones contain an average of seven sensors A rapidly growing number of mobile apps use them to know where you are and what you are doing Such sensor surveillance may sound creepy to some but it enables mobile devices to provide users with highly personalized benefits from a special offer on an item in a store window to a warning of a road hazard around the next curve Sensors know when you are heading or leaving home and can adjust your contextual thermostat accordingly
 Phones know where you are and where you have been Police are now getting subpoenas to establish or refute alibis of suspects through their phones location records Police investigators use them to reconstruct the last hours in a murder victims life andlike it or notyour phones are keeping an ongoing log of what happens wherever you take them They already know what building you are in Not too far into the future your mobile device will also know what floor you are on what room you are in and in which direction you are moving 
 Sensors are being used in a number of promising mobile applications that alert stores when loyal customers walk in They warn you when your car wanders out of its lane They know when you are touching a box on a retail shelf or when your running shoes need replacing
 For example if you use a mobile app calledHighlight youll be able to find people who interest you and who are physically within a football fields distance from where you stand Likewise when you walk through the door stores will know whether you are a frequent buyer or someone with an arrest record for shoplifting and you will be treated in the context of who you are
 Sensors can tell you where your keys are orwho your dog likes They are embedded in prosthetichands restoring the sensation of touch In an upcoming chapter on the contextual city well explain how sensors can see changes in traffic patterns and adjust signal lights in response and how sensors can warn first responders of unseen hazards and show them where injured or unconscious people can be found amid smoke and rubble
 Well tell you about how they have alerted people to grave danger In Japanin 2011 sensors warned officials 65 seconds before theTohoku earthquake and tsunamihit giving them just enough time to stop bullet trains heading toward peril thus saving thousands of lives Following the disaster sensors helped citizens build a highradiation heat map that warned them of places to avoid
 In fact sensors will play a role in nearly every chapter of this book The same sensors you already use in todays mobile devices can tell your car when to hit the brakes and avoid collision if you are too slow to respond They know whether you are sky diving or sleeping In homes they know if there is too much smoke or if the lights should be turned on 
 One mobile app we like is Shark Net which uses sensors attached to buoys and robotic surfboards toting underwater cameras to track shark movements Over time marine biologists are starting to understand the patterns of each individual shark and are getting good at predicting when a specific shark can be expected to appear in a particular place Shark Net was designed to serve marine biologists but you can bet surfers are using it as well
 The military uses sensors on vehicles andbody armorto detect environmental changes and head trauma Sensors can detect motion caused by enemy combatants and their bullets Some veterinarians use motion sensorsto detect lameness in racehorses
 An environmentally friendly company Sensible Self makes GreenGoose cute little wireless stickers containing motion sensors that allow you to track anything that moves from a pet or child to your phone or even to check if your spouse left the toilet seat up
 Melanie Martella Executive Editor ofSensorsmagazine introduced us to the concept ofsensor fusiona fastemerging technology thattakes data from disparate sources to come up with more accurate complete and dependable data Sensor fusion enables the same sense of depth that is available in 3D modeling which is used for all modern design and construction as well as the magic of special effects in movies
 Sensors will understand if you are pilfering office supplies or engaging in a clandestine office affair If you are a burglar your phone might end up bearing witness against you and in fact your car will be able to testify if you were parked in an area you deny having visitedand it will be able to report when you were there and if it was you in the car
 Many of these scenarios are already part of your life Soon they will become even more integral and they will be inextricable from life itself in the Age of Context
 Location


 In September 2012 Apple launched its own mobile maps It took very little time for the public to realize that they were so awful as to be comedic But the humor got lost if you were using them to find your way along a snowy road late at night
 Apple Maps somehow managed to erase famous landmarks from their sites in the worlds major cities others were relocated under bodies of water Drivers reported that turnbyturn voice directions were misguiding them occasionally urging them to take abrupt turns midspan on suspension bridges
 The maps were so flawed that CEO Tim Cook soon publicly apologized encouraging customers to use competing products including Google Maps It was a headscratcher How could a company universally acclaimed for unmatched product elegance make such an unmitigated gaffe
 Some pointed to a bitter and public divorce between Apple and Google Steve Jobs had considered Google Android to be a direct ripoff of Apples iOS operating system Could Apple Maps have simply been a crudely devised and poorly executed act of revenge against a powerful former ally We think not In our view Apple made a huge mistake but it was strategically motivated and not part of a petty Silicon Valley vendetta
 Although Google and Apple historically had lots of good reasons to be allies they were destined to become the rivals they now are In the past tech companies were pretty much divided between hardware and software so an alliance between world leaders in each of the two categories was formidable to say the least
 Apple was clearly the pacesetter in worldchanging mobile hardware But hardware eventually becomes a commodity These days many of Apples competitors offer similar and occasionally superior features often at lower prices
 When search ruled the universe Google was perched on the throne However Google saw they would need to achieve more to retain their position and became adept and strategic as an online software provider
 Business models for Apple and Google have been rapidly evolving in recent years and Facebook is a new pretender to that throne Google Apple and Facebook now understand the biggest issue facing them today is being where people will spend the most time online That is not a device issue but a mobile app issue
 To remain a leader Apple and Google each needed to vie for online time for alliances with thirdparty developers and to provide platforms that make those apps valuable For Google that meant having its own operating system for Apple it meant having maps because it saw the unquestionable value of locationbased services For Apple and many companies mobile apps are the secret sauce of the Age of Context mobile mapping is the most strategic of all categories 
 Caterina Fake CEO and founder of Findery a locationbased platform explains it best in a statement that is simultaneously obvious and profound Without location there is no context And for Apple without context there will be no leadership
 So Apple and Google divorced Today Android and iOS compete for mobile operating system dominance and thus Apple had little choice but to develop its own maps Its big mistake was not in the play but in being unprepared for the enormous challenges they faced on an unrealistically short timeline and then blindly plowing forward
 By the time Apple Maps launched Google had about 7000 employees working on its mobile maps Matching that is nearly impossible for Apple whose entire company has only 20000 employees Google has a sevenyear lead in every aspect of the category Now Apple faces a formidable up ramp and they have amplified the problem by drawing attention to it and failing with their first shot Apple Maps are improving in accuracy but regaining user confidence and loyalty will take a long time
 We turned to Daniel Graf Director of Google Mobile Maps to explain just what it takes to build a map platform and to get some sense of where the company is going Graf is not a professional cartographer Hes an entrepreneur with a background in consumer mobile software
 Hes been at Google since 2011 Graf says that to do maps right there are three essential components
 Build a foundation The foundation of all maps is data Google started by licensing data from other cartography companies In 2007 it started gathering its own By the time Graf talked with us in September 2012 the company had gathered geographically relevant data in 30 countries over seven years and had added such exotic places as the Galapagos Islands where Darwin once explored In most places company employees drive around in specially equipped cars with tons of sensors that analyze everything from road width direction street signs localized spellings etc Then Google takes a look at the same streets and neighborhoods via satellite which it makes available via Google Earth 
 In the case of the Galapagos Google sent in their Street View team despite the fact that there are no streets on the pristine Pacific island They reduced the technology contained in the usual cars to be small enough to fit in 40pound backpacks so the team could carry them around the island The project would not have been possible without tiny sensors which also helped the team observe under water
 The Galapagos anecdote shows another reason that Graf seems unworried about a future Apple map project You cannot win in maps by investing dollars you have to invest time This is not a process that can be sped up Graf says It appears to us that Googles sevenyear head start will be difficult to overtake
 Keep Track of Changes Graf says that perhaps the most daunting challenge is keeping current with local data which is in a state of constant flux Street names addresses and directions change all the time A dry cleaner closes and a Starbucks opens at the same address Old buildings get demolished and new ones rise Google uses multiple sources to stay current the most significant one being their users who are encouraged to report mistakes when they find them 
 Personalize Through Integration Maps become more valuable when they have a sense of where people are what they are doing and what they want to do next 
 Your software needs to understand the context when you type in Thai Do you want to find a south Asian country or a restaurant in Lower Manhattan This is the area of greatest focus for Google Maps and the need to understand personalization is spread across the companys growing collection of tightly integrated software services and platforms This integration lets each Google app share what it knows about you with other Google apps
 Graf noted that the first two components of success in mapping involve data while the third involves context He estimated it would take Apple about a year from the time we talked to catch up in the first two areas He implied that by that point Google would have leapfrogged ahead mostly by addressing the third issue
 We had the impression that Googles strategic goal is to become the ultimate contextual company and we find them well positioned to become precisely that It explains why Google is driving hard to produce Google Glass 
 It explains still further why Google had to develop the Android operating system so it could evolve into the mobile platform that wins the whoknowsitsusersbest contest It also explains why Google does not aspire to become a headtohead social network competitor with Facebook but instead plans to be the social network most closely integrated with Googles expanding suite of contextual products
 Google wants to know you so well that it can predict what you will do next It tries to answer your inquiries on any of its products based on the context of where you are What time do Thai restaurants close in a specific neighborhood Wheres the cheapest parking Is there a high crime rate in that area 
 Will Apple ever catch up with Google We have no idea but we hope so We dont root for one company over another We remain steadfastly on the side of the userand when we users have choices innovation accelerates and prices drop 
 A host of new locationbased services from creative and brilliant startups have sprung up recently and we anticipate many more to come They of course cannot work without mapsanother reason Apple needs to get back into the game as fast as it can These thirdparty apps cannot exist without maps because as Caterina Fake says without them there is no context
 The granddaddy of locationbased services is Foursquare which was founded way back in 2009 It is a locationbased social network that lets users check in based on where they are In its first two years Foursquare attracted over 20 million registered users 
 By 2013 Foursquare users had checked in more than a billion times giving the company an astoundingly large database on shopper location and individual store preferences For example if youve shopped once a month for the last two years on Saturday mornings at the Costco in Everett Massachusetts Foursquare knows this It can help nearby retailers offer you specials relevant to your purchasing habits where you are likely to be at that time and day and whether you live or shop a few miles north of Boston 
 If you also frequent Home Depot Foursquare knows you might want to attend the Massachusetts Home Show in the citys Hynes Civic Auditorium When you check in on Foursquare show exhibitors may offer you special deals
 Foursquare remains popular but a plethora of more sophisticated locationbased mobile services have recently come to market Some allow you to do all sorts of things based on your personal preferences When you are snow skiing they will know where you are located how fast you are going and thus when you will arrive at the lodge and when to have that Irish coffee they know you favor ready to be poured as you amble up to the bar 
 Perhaps you paid for your adult beverage in advance with a webstored credit card activated by a nod blink or gesture your digital eyewear understood Some software doesnt know you at all but sends offers to a map location so anyone who checks on their map gets the offer when they are nearby
 This and many other nascent revolutionary applications of contextual software are right around the corner 
 From a contextual perspective we hold Google in particularly high regard but the real gamechanging development is the gadget Scoble is wearing on our back coverGoogle Glass
 

 Chapter 2


 Through the Glass Looking

 Right now most of us look at the people with Google Glass like the dudes who first walked around with the big brick phones

 Amber Naslund SideraWorks

 The first of them went to Sergey Brin Larry Page and Eric Schmidt Brin who runs Project Glass the companys muchtouted digital eyewear program has rarely been seen in public again without them
 Before anyone outside the company could actually touch the device or see the world through its perspective the hoopla had begun and has not stopped Neither has the controversy 
 Google Glass is the flagship contextual device It is the first consumer electronics gadget that uses a new kind of infrared eye sensor that watches your pupil Thus it knows where you look
 Over the next few years Google plans to build a new kind of contextaware operating system around Glass and its sensors In other words the operating system will make use of the devices awareness of your location activity and implied intention It will know whether you are walking running skiing biking shopping or driving and tailor information to you accordingly But thats a future development Google spent most of 2013 building and testing Glass in full public view
 Google usually tightlipped before products are launched started titillating the public with juicy previews At a developer conference in June 2012 nine months prior to releasing an Explorer version to technologists skydivers leapt from a blimp over San Francisco demonstrating what the city looks like as you hurtle through the air to a designated landing area 
 A month later Project Glass converged with Project Runway at a tony Manhattan fashion show where models paraded wearing the sleek devices and expensive couture The company understood that if Glass is to be worn on the face it has to be perceived as fashionable
 Brin started speaking publicly with far greater frequency than is his habit He was seen riding in a New York City subway wearing the device The company produced periodic videos on its YouTube property showing how productive and enjoyable life through Glass could be
 But that was all concept Some of what was promised in advance was no more real in the early stages of public scrutiny than a little girls fantasy that she could follow a harelate for a datethrough a looking glass and down a huge hole in a big tree
 The first people outside of Google to touch Glass were about 2000 independent developers influencers and tech journalists who started receiving the Explorer Version in April 2013 It was something less than had been portrayed in the conceptual videosbut simultaneously it was something more than anyone had ever experienced
 For developers who might build the apps that would help Glass meet its potential the cost was 1500 each and there wasnt much you could do with it that you couldnt already do with a smartphone Still most people who tried them saw greatperhaps even historicpotential 
 Many suggested something new you could do with Glass Some thought it would change the relationship between people and devicesfor better or worse We are among those who think it will be for the better
 In the following months another 6000 Glass devices were parsed out to winners of the If I had Glass contest that the company ran This group was composed of fewer technical professionals but by virtue of the contest they won they were articulate people eager to be in the front of the line and positioned to feel they had just wonrather than paid 1500 In short they were predisposed to speak kindly of Glass
 In those first months however new functionality accrued steadilyif unremarkably The New York Times reported that you could do useful and interesting little tasks like take pictures read and use Twitter Path Tumblr and Facebook 
 Again those were tasks you could already perform on your phoneexcept a few things were very different You did all these things hands free Your computer was seeing what you were seeing at the same time as you were Instead of typing to instruct your device you just talked to it in natural language or used taps and gestures 
 Long before Glass was offered to the general public new and unique experiences were observed and reported By August 2013 we were attending hackathons where we saw apps that used Glass to play games fly drones help doctors and control robots Unfortunately our writing deadlines required us to finish this chapter before such new applications became available before Google announced its actual retail price and before everyday people got to spend any time at all using Glass 
 We did however enjoy a good deal of handson experience ourselves and we paid close attention to what other early adopters reported Some shared our unsinkable enthusiasm others thought less of it Respected journalists such as VentureBeats Jolie ODell declared This isnt and never will be a good device for consumers Others were even less kind
 What is unquestionable is that Glass the first facially mounted personal computing device intended for mass markets got into the conversation A Bing search for Google Glass generated 149 million results on May 10 2013 up by more than 125 million in about 30 days 
 In fact we can think of no product service or media event that has ever become a worldwide recognized brand so early in its development No product has ever been so craved or vilified so long before it was available
 Many who could draw attention by inciting fear uncertainty and doubt were active early
 
 The Five Point Cafe a Seattle neighborhood tavern banned the device without ever seeing one The proprietor made it clear he didnt want any geeks spying on his patrons 
 Gary Howell a state representative in West Virginia proposed a ban on driving while Glassing
 A national petition was started to prohibit Glass use as an illegal surveillance device although it did not specify just how that surveillance would be conducted or by whom
 Jeff Bercovici a Forbes staff writer warned Glass would make classroom cheating rampant 
 Theaters where recording or taking pictures with any device is already prohibited started issuing bans specifically addressed to the new device 
 The Urban Dictionary a compendium of streetwise lingo added a listing Glassholea person who constantly talks to his Google Glass ignoring the outside world
 All this angst was expressed by people who had not yet touched the deviceand perhaps never will 
 Glass was not the first digital eyewear to be introduced nor was it the second It wasnt even the first to freak people out Steve Mann a Canadian professor was enjoying lunch with his family at a McDonalds on the Champs lyses in Paris when staff members who found the device he was wearing disturbing dragged him out of the establishment and into the street
 Oakley the design maestros had no such problems when they launched Airwave highend ski goggles that feature GPS Bluetooth and a small screen inside that lets you see where your friends are on the mountain where you are how fast youre skiing and even the hang time of your last jump 
 So why all the attention Is it just noise or is something new and significant going on
 We believe something monumental is taking place something that could change your life and work your childrens future and the world in which your unborn descendants will live
 Not Another Day


 Scoble was the 107th person to receive a Google Glass prototype He put them on and immediately started posting short notes on his social networks about his experience He wore them when he went to Europe making presentations at tech conferences and letting hundreds of people give his Glass device a quick try
 After two weeks he posted his first review to Google the default social network for Google Glass users declaring Im never going to live another day without a wearable computer on my face
 To illustrate his point his wife Maryam photographed him in the shower wearing his Glass Some scorned the stunt If Google Glass fails it is Robert Scobles fault bemoaned authorspeaker Peter Shankman in a blog post Larry Page Googles CEO told Scoble in front of a large audience that he did not appreciate the shower photo 
 Unperturbed Scoble spent far more time taking pictures than posing for them In his first four months with Glass he took more than 6000 photosalong with dozens of videosand he had only just begun He says thats about double the rate he was shooting on his smartphones
 Scoble has built a career interviewing developers of innovative technologies He is known for both his candor and his enthusiasm He is said to have a sharp eye for spotting new products with great potential 
 But even he acknowledges that Glass is not appropriate in every situation For example he raises them up inside public bathrooms to avoid claims hes recording He also feels uncomfortable wearing his Glass on date nights in nice restaurants and so on They have a fashion cost Scoble says
 While Scoble whistlestopped through Europe Israel stayed home writing Age of Context He followed Scobles posts with interest and concern The idea for the book had been partly inspired by Glass long before it was a tangible product and Israel worried that Scoble may have overstated the case He worried about all the negative comments being amplified across the internet 
 Israel does not adopt technology as early as Scoble does although he is usually a few steps ahead of the mainstream He worries about unintended consequences and loss of privacy as well as lesser matters such as the paucity of apps
 Immediate Want


 Israel got to see Glass firsthand for the first time in May 2013 He was scheduled to spend the day with Scoble at SRI International the venerable and prolific independent research and development facility in Menlo Park to interview researchers for this book
 Early in the day he tried on Scobles device for about 60 seconds His concerns evaporated He immediately wanted one He might not vow to wear it every day but knew he wanted one and would find many uses for it 
 It took only that single minute for him to understand how such a device would improve his productivity give him access to information and enable new forms of communication He also thought the device was fun recognizing that the business value of fun is frequently underrated
 Many of Israels friends are in their upper 50s and 60s He knew he would be chided and disparaged by somebut Glass would be worth it He recalled how he was kidded when he first started wearing a Bluetooth device and how several of those who reproached him were now wearing the device 
 Reluctantly he handed Glass back to Scoble but he didnt share his thoughts He wanted to see how others at SRI responded as they met with the two authors Would they be comfortable being interviewed by someone with a computer on his face Would it change the context of the conversation
  SRI conducts a great deal of proprietary research some of it for the government How would people who operated in a security bubble feel about Scoble wearing a device thats being banned from sports bars and restrooms
 During the day a stream of SRI executives sat down to talk with the authors about their respective technologies The conversation invariably started with Glass People looked at the device perched in front of Scobles eyes They seemed to experience the same discomfort you might feel if an old friend showed up for dinner sporting a radically changed hairstyle 
 Invariably each interviewee asked to try it on Within 60 seconds each understood how it worked and a smile formed on every face Each seemed reluctant to hand the device back As the interviews proceeded Israel noticed how quickly the SRI folk became comfortable talking with Scoble Very quickly Glass became as unobtrusive as the oldfashioned glasses sitting on Israels nose
 A couple of hours into the day Israel realized a remarkable thing His eye contact with his partner had improved Scoble wasnt constantly staring at and tapping on the small screen of his phone as he was so prone to do Glass had improved the way we related to each other
 SRI was an easy test It is staffed by some of the worlds smartest technologists many even geekier than Scoble Next the coauthors visited downtown Palo Alto the heart of Silicon Valley This would not be equivalent to a field test in a Peoria shopping center but at least it was less techcentric than SRI 
 We sat at the bar at Tamarine a fashionable Vietnamese restaurant It was late afternoon and most patrons seemed more interested in adult beverages than cuisine An older man stared at Scoble He finished his drink and approached 
 Israel anticipated a confrontation but the man politely asked to try on the digital eyewear It was the same as at SRI 60 seconds a broad smile and reluctantly returning the device Its the future the man declared nodding and smiling as he walked out the door 
 The bartender was next another 60 seconds and more nods and smiles Then a couple of other patrons more demos nods and smiles
 We ate dinner at the bar as Tamarine became packed receiving curious yet fleeting looks as people soon returned to their food and drink This was far different than what Professor Mann had experienced at the Paris McDonalds
 Finishing dinner we strolled along University Avenue Walking Palo Altos main street with Scoble is like strolling Manhattans Fifth Avenue with Michael Bloomberg People stopped us every few minutes some knew Scoble others didnt know him but still asked if they could try on his Glass and of course he said yes
 It was always the same 60 seconds smiles and reluctant handbacks Thats all it took to understand Glass to realize its potential and to want one
 We heard complaints about price not privacy People didnt seem to realize that the Glass they were seeing was an expensive prototype
 Israels Facebook post the following morning reflected Glass is the most immersive technology I have ever experienced It will get a lot better and cheaper It will change the worldprobably not the worlds of aging Boomers like me but such devices will be an essential component in the worlds of my grandchildren Their lives will be better for that fact
 Looking Back to See Forward


 Please understand that Glass as it exists is a catalyst not a lightning bolt Some years will pass before people look back and try to understand how they ever could have lived without such a device 
 Scoble tells audiences its like seeing the first Apple IIs as they rolled off the assembly line in 1977 They were like nothing people had seen before but you couldnt do much with them Decision makers at HP and Atari werent interested in cutting a deal with Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs for rights to market their new computerthe new highly personalized devices were obviously too radically different to sell in significant quantity
 Yet it turned out a lot of people wanted them and the Apple II kicked off a 20year explosion of invention and productivity that we now remember as the PC revolution Google Glass will do the same
 How long will it take Were not sure Our best guess is between five and ten years And the price will need to be a lot lower
  Although analysts sometimes deny it all forecasts are guesswork The future very often surprises us We find the best way of anticipating what lies ahead is to look back Lets look back to what got us to today in mobile gear
 In 1940 a device was developed to allow Allied soldiers fighting the Japanese to talk to each other wirelessly in the field As urban legend has it a soldier on patrol on some Pacific Island was using the device while hiking past a jungle village An indigenous inhabitant pointed at him in amazement declaring walkietalkie The name stuck
 Seventy years later the walkietalkieexpanded in capability and reduced to pocketsizebecame an essential component of modern life Sometimes the best way to understand how far forward something can go is to look back and see how far it has come 
 With that in mind try to fathom just what will emerge over the next few decades During a visit to SRI where so many great technologies such as HDTV and Siri were invented Supun Samarasekera a technical director from SRIs Princeton Group showed us a pair of augmented reality binoculars that let you geotag messages for colleagues and etch in virtual people among real ones in real places A military platoon could create a very realistic modern version of the famous Terracotta Army if they wished or you could tag a window in a building to show friends your apartment or business prospects the location of your office
 The SRI binoculars are being designed for US military use today but you can see how they could be used for games entertainment retailing real estate uberpersonalized maps and more The device today is cumbersome enough to require a tripod to steady it but Samarasekera says eventually the technology could be incorporated into Glass or some other digital eyewear device
 It may go even further Seventy years from nowthe time it took for the walkietalkie to evolve into todays smartphonethe amazing capabilities of this technology might be embedded into a pair of contact lenses or be directly connected to your brain powered by your bodys electricity 
 Instead of using taps and gestures perhaps your grandkids will operate the technology by brainwaves as a University of Washington research project has already demonstrated can be done Instead of looking at a tiny screen perhaps your progeny will watch 3D holograms hover in the aira technology being researched today
 Beyond Palo Alto


 What starts in Palo Alto rarely stays in Palo Alto It soon spreads to Peoria Pittsburgh Paris Phnom Penh Pago Pago and everywhere else touched by the internet And it keeps happening faster and faster 
 As you look forward 5 10 50 years from now the future does not belong to us but to our kids and their kids When Scoble brought his Glass to a Mets game two young kids saw him and asked to try them on Awesome they said Their parents were less than thrilled 
 Maybe those kids wont get Glass for Christmas next year but what happens when they have their own discretionary income We think younger generations will embrace handsfree devices so vigorously they will refuse to ever let go and personally we think that is a good thing
 Overcoming the Freaky Factor


 In Naked Conversations our book on how blogs are changing the way businesses talk with customers we painted an imaginary picture of a blacksmith at the turn of the last century He stands pounding horseshoes on an anvil A few cronies sit nearby chatting and whittling
 Suddenly theres a loud and unfamiliar noisea mixture of roar clatter and sputter Then the first car they have ever seen chugs past them They watch silently drinking in the oddity Then they laugh You forgot the horse one calls out and then more laughter 
 The blacksmith resumes his hammering unaware that the horseless carriage has already and forever changed his life How could such a crude and limited machine ever replace a horse How could that crude machine ever become a Tesla But that is what will happen before the blacksmiths great grandson graduates college 
  In 1900 the blacksmith was an essential community member Communities that had no doctors had blacksmiths How could they so quickly and unceremoniously go extinct like dinosaurs
 Human dinosaurs are different than those that once dominated the planet Over the years our species has grown taller and we stand more upright but mostly we evolve by building better tools Our stone axes become weapons of mass destruction our ox carts now fly 
 As British author Arthur C Clarke wrote The limits of the possible can only be defined by going beyond them into the impossible That is what Glass is about to do
 Wearing Glass makes us understand how such devices will enhance many everyday activities giving us new perspectives on reality adding information and data and letting us capture the moment
 The Specs


 Now lets look at the device itself and what you see when you wear it The right side of Glass is thicker and heavier than the left The part that fits over the right ear contains a boneconductive speaker and battery Forward and above your right eye is the soul of Glassa translucent visual prism about the size and shape of a sugar cube 
 This prism is where users see menus read text and email view content see command options and enjoy photos and videos When someone calls the prism displays the callers identity then you tell Glass to answer or ignore If you are familiar with Bluetooth the experience is similar but with Glasss visual enhancement you dont have to look down at a phone
 The Glass prism or screen floats just above your right eye providing a deep and richly colored display That visual quality is a main reason so many people smiled when they saw the world through Scobles Glass Looking at the tiny screen is far easier than people realize
 The front component also contains an inwardly directed microphone an eye sensor and Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity The wide righthand stem serves as a touchpad This is where you tap or slide your fingers to give commands or scroll through content 
 Due to battery limitations the device always defaults to off To wake it you blink press a small button or tilt your head back The tilting gesture is a bit odd to behold A Saturday Night Live skit had a field day mocking this feature We think most people will stick to taps and blinks
  Two magic words bring Glass to life OK Glass cues it that a voice command such as take a picture is coming 
 The microphone is intentionally pointed inward Glass is not great for conducting interviews or recording an eavesdropped conversation The quality of nonwearer voices deteriorates just a few feet away 
 NBC Tech Reporter Rosa Golijan wrote that she was wearing Glass in an elevator when a man leaned in very close and said OK Glass take a picture Glass did nothing It would be very difficult for someone other than the wearer to fool the device into thinking they were the user 
 Killer Apps and KillerCatching 


 While some industry observers have discounted Glass because there is no killer app Glasss phototaking capability already is one Its not the clicking of the photo itself so much as the speed of the click
 We have experimented and the time it took to get our smartphones out of our pockets and into our hands scroll and click on our camera app choose the right photo or video option and finally point and click is as long as 12 seconds When we didnt play quick draw it came out to 18 to 20 secondslonger if we left our phone in another room
 By contrast it takes about one second to say OK Glass take a picture So you can capture an image up to 18 times faster with Glass than with a smartphone Not only that Glass phototaking is hands free so you can snap while running pushing a baby stroller or jogging
 Think of the photos in your life you may have missed your babys first step a teenagers gamewinning jump shot even a terrorist dropping a backpack at a marathon finish line All these shots could have been captured with Glass but missed with a phone Thus we think of Glass phototaking as not just a killer app but as an app that can catch a killer 
 A Very Personal Assistant


 Despite similarities to other mobile apps the dynamic between you and Glass is different from anything youve ever experienced It makes your relationship with the device more up close and personal Over time Glass comes to understand your personal patterns and to anticipate what you want to know see eat or buy
 Stefan Weitz director of research at Microsoft talked to us of the day when you will see a shirt in a store window then blink or just say buy Your facial device will know your intent It will check the web to see if there are any deals on the item and then buy it from a retailer you trust that offers the lowest price It will complete the transaction with your credit card and have the shirt sent to you via your preferred method of shipping
 Very often your personal assistant will anticipate what you want to do before you do and suggest an action to take on your behalf Whats relevant here is that over time Glass will contain software that will come to know you better than the closest people in your life
 Does that sound eerie Perhaps but it will also be very very convenient Your eyelevel computer will be with you through nearly all your waking hours sharing each experience It will remember them more accurately than you can and will record your most important moments for your future enjoyment and the enjoyment of those who love you
 Mass Market Potential


 We dont know what the eventual retail price for Glass will be However IHS Inc a company that analyzes products like Glass estimates that eyewear computers will retail for about 400 based on the costs of components and assembly But they seem to be using the 100 percent markup formula upon which most consumer products manufacturers base their pricing
 We think Google will end up selling Glass at closer to costprobably between 200 and 300 making their profits from supplemental sales as razor manufacturers profit from replacement blades Google already does this with its Nexus 7 tablet We speculate that Google will derive the bulk of its Glass revenue from the micro commissions on retail transactions it generates Retailers will pay Google a small percentage each time a customer blinks to buy a shirt or gets coaxed into a restaurant or purchases a romantic weekend getaway package
 Of course it wont just be Google We understand that Microsoft Blink is developing technology in this direction and we assume they will not be alone in just a few years from now
 Micro commissions could produce billions in revenue for large internet companies and they can do that without having to annoy customers with todays intrusive and ineffective kinds of advertisingan issue we will revisit in Chapter 11 
 This is conjecture on our part Googles strategy for monetizing Glass is a closely guarded secret among company executives We base it on Googles current ban on advertising on its most contextual products We think the company will be wiser and wealthier if it keeps to this course
 Coming Soon  Perhaps


 In the coming months and years we expect to see more than a million new mobile apps for Glass and for the other digital eyewear devices yet to be developed
 Many will perform functions already being conducted on other mobile devices some will go beyond Imagine
 Bicyclists runners swimmers and other serious athletes seeing routes competitors status race statistics and personal health data during training and races
 Doctors using Glass to conduct actual facetoface conversations with patients rather than burying their heads in the screens of HIPAA Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act terminals 
 Surgeons seeing vital data superimposed on magnifications of the patients vital areas
 Police using facial recognition in a proprietary app to see the record of a suspect They will record video while pursuing a suspect that could be used in a court to prove the suspect resisted arrest
 Games using your facial and body movements for an immersive experience of play and enjoyment A Glass app that enables you to play Frogger by jumping up and down like a frog is a simple currently available example
 Archeologists and videographers controlling a drone simply by looking and using some gestures 
 Security guards similarly controlling remote cameras They might say OK Glass turn on GoPro camera 1 to search for a missing child at an amusement park
 Those apps just scratch the surface Were sure you can add to the list Just let your imagination be your guide Somewhere out there an ambitious and capable developer may already be working on it
 Big Vertical Apps


 We think Google and its imminent competitors will be focused on horizontal consumer applications and rightfully so This however leaves huge opportunities on the businesstobusiness B2B side of the marketplace where opportunities for headmounted technology abound
 Pairasight Inc an Ann Arborbased startup seems to be the first mover in B2B In fact they brought their stereoscopic 3D twoway livestreaming industrialstrength devices to market before Google launched Glass They are working on deals covering about 35 vertical categories
 We first met founder and CEO Christopher Salow at the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show CES in Las Vegas where he let us examine a prototype of the companys device Considering its capability we were surprised by its simplicity
 A few months later Aaron Salow Christophers son and Pairasights launch director told us the company was in several serious talks a couple of which sounded potentially significant 
 At our book deadline Pairasight was in alpha tests with a Michiganbased service that provides remote diagnostic support to local auto mechanics working on elite vehicles Currently the local mechanics video record a problem on under the hood then email a clip to the automotive experts in Michigan If all goes well the experts send back their recommendations in 24 hoursor ask additional questions which require more time 
 Owners of exotic cars are not often characterized as patient people Repair delays are rarely well received
 The Pairasight OEM application will allow the local mechanic and the remote expert to use Pairasight glasses for twoway livestream conversations While the mechanic pokes around under the hood the expert watches listens asks questions and make suggestions Problems often will be repaired on the spot 
 The customer gets faster better service The local guy enhances his reputation and can accommodate more customers because cars cycle in and out of the shop faster The Michigan diagnostic center can scale because each expert can cover more ground
 Aaron Salow lives in Tennessee where Nashville is the medical hub for the entire state Quality health care is available in the big city but in rural areas quality and emergency care are almost nonexistent he told us
 However with Pairasight a Nashville expert can help a country doctor save a life The 3D capability lets the consulting physician see far more than a simple Xray could show The expert can virtually see through the eyes of the local doctor wearing Pairasight during an operation
 The device is also being tested in South Korea where Seoul is the medical hub and practitioners who lack adequate training often have to perform surgeries in rural districts
 Pairasights potential seems quite large Take customer services Suppose you want to build a deck onto your home but you could use a contractor who has experience building decks Home Depot or Lowes could loan you the digital eyewear and then have a staff expert help you remotely A single expert could cover a lot of ground creating a new aftermarket business
 Competition 


 Glass Pairasight and Oakley are the early arrivals in the new digital eyewear category and each has found unique and potentially valuable ways to take advantage of being first to market But they will not be alone for long There are rumors that Apple Microsoft Samsung and Nokia are all planning digital eyewear products 
 Spunky challengers are already getting ready to join the fray with lowpriced variations A couple of Stanford University students have started Epiphany Eyewear which in May 2013 was taking preorders for digital sunglasses at 399 each They are producing the frames on a 3D printer
 Recon Instruments which made the technology used in the Oakley Airwave ski goggles discussed earlier has announced its own Recon Jet a tough but attractive set of digital goggles that runs on Android and is targeted for athletes who will use them in rugged environments 
 Framed in Fashion


 Being seen in digital eyewear is new and different and draws more attention than users may want At first people behave just a little differently when they see you but as we experienced in Palo Alto this may soon wear off Plus the device will become smaller and less obtrusive over time and we expect it will become far more fashionable Google has made Glass as sleek and subtle as may be possible today They are already displaying a sensitivity to the fashion factor by offering a choice of six colors with such chic names as Charcoal Tangerine and Sky 
 Neither of us is known to be particularly fashionconscious but both of us spend a good deal of time selecting our eyeglasses because they become part of our faces It is a sensitive issue 
 Currently there is only one Glass style Google tells us that when its released to the public more choices will be available including ones for prescription eyeglass wearers
 Bill Geiser CEO of Fort Worthbased MetaWatch a wearabledevice platform wonders if Google a company whose culture is steeped in algorithms and data understands the importance of fashion when marketing computers to be worn on the bridge of your nose
 In his view wearable devices that are worn elsewhere may be a safer bet for wearable device makers Watches and jewelry have always communicated status and selfexpression he says so adding digital technology to them is a natural evolution
 Google Glass works for Scoble because it accurately represents who he is and what he loves Im not sure that most people will view Glass as he does Geiser says
 Geiser points out that people still violate laws prohibiting using phones in cars because they dont want to wear a Bluetooth headset that makes them look like the Borg As for Glass Geiser may very well prove to be right but we think he wont One reason is that the penalties for using a smartphone while driving continue to increase In New York that activity will get you three to five violation points on your driving record
 Also Googles fashion model stunt showed the companys sensitivity to the fashion factor More than that eyewear itself has become a fashion item For mysterious reasons some professional basketball players have taken to wearing eyeglass frames without lenses Some speculate it gives them a more intellectual look at news conferences 
 For everyday people many fashion brands market logo eyewear A brief visit to a local retailer showed offerings from Oakley Coach Kate Spade Gucci and even the staid Brooks Brothers 
 There are rumors that Google is working with eyeglass innovator Warby Parker Perhaps the next design will come from Parker and down the line shoppers will visit their local LensCrafters for a device that fits their taste budget and selfimage
 We are optimistic about Glass Google has shown itself to be a longview player and when you are devising worldchanging technology you need to think in terms of products for children born today and imagine what they will want in 20 years
 Fashion is important If Glass is perceived as geeky then only geeks will wear it If it looks fashionably desirable then it may get to swim in the mainstream Fashion could be a barrier if Google does not play it right 
 Bad for Spying


 A second issue relates to how Glass sees what you see some people may become very defensive thinking you have the ability to record and spy on them in extremely unlikely ways
 For some reason much attention has been given to Glass being used to spy on people in public restroomssomething that would be both foolish and dangerous Glass can only capture whats directly in the users line of vision and when it does the prism glows When you snap a shot it emits an audible ping In short if you use it inappropriately in restrooms or elsewhere you will likely get caught and the response may be far worse than what Steve Mann experienced in Paris
 It is far easier to take clandestine pictures or video with a smartphone or worse with an almost undetectable Memoto wearable lifelogging camera that automatically and silently snaps a shot every 30 seconds 
 In our view a great number of inaccurate reports are dramatically overstating legitimate concerns about illicit data collection and downright spying
 Who Watches Whom


 The biggest barrier to digital eyewear acceptance is neither competition nor fashion Rather concerns about privacy and the potential for surveillance are likely to stop many people for a whileand some people foreverfrom trying smart glasses
 What is rarely discussed is our greatest concern what happens in the opposite direction When you wear Glass or a similar device it watches what you watch Data is being collected on everything you look at If Glass is to fulfill the promise of becoming the ultimate personal assistant it obviously needs to know everything about you 
 But who owns that data and how can it be reused It appears that Google believes it is the keeper owner and decision maker It Google has been collecting user data vigorously for many years 
 So far the company has a respectable record for not abusing it Despite the fact that it acquired a facial recognition company in 2010 it has said it will not incorporate that technology into Glass 
 At the 2013 Google IO developer conference Glass product manager Steve Lee told thousands of conference attendees that design and function decisions were made to protect user privacy at every point along the way We find that reassuring perhaps even encouragingbut not bulletproof In its first week in developer hands Glass was hacked twice by technologists who did it just to show it could be done
 Even if a Glass device is stolen and hackedor even loaned to a friend for an extended period Google could potentially shut it down A thief cannot impersonate you and make purchases with your stored credit card information It may sound eerie but there are benefits to a device being so smart it knows its owner and will follow directions from no one else
 The fact is that all technology is ultimately vulnerable Theoretically any system that has been built can be hacked and abused Some bad guys have great technical skills and creative imaginations What we can tell you is that a malicious alteration seems less likely with Glass than the warnings of those who have done little thinking or research on the subject would have you believe
 Google may not be anything like Big Brother in George Orwells 1984 but it most certainly will be watching you
 Data ownership questions will be debated for a long time before they are answered Meanwhile the stewardship seems to fall to Google and other datagathering companies 
 What will happen when a government agency wants to see that data for reasons of national security suspicion of criminal activity tax evasion or whatever What about journalists job recruiters and divorce lawyers Will we have any say in who sees our data Will we even be informed when it is being requested for scrutiny
 Personally we trust the people who run Google today to act responsibly But the company is not yet 20 years old and it looks like it will be around for a long long time Who will run it 20 years from today Will they be guided more by ethics or profit
 What decisions will they make Will future decision makers decide more on financial issues or temper their decisions with ethical considerations as well We cannot answer those questions nor can the top brass at Googleor any other company because the issue of data ownership will be one that every modern company will have to deal with
 We consider this a cause for concern We hope this will be an issue of prolonged transparent debate
 We will circle back to the continuing and complex issue of privacy in the new contextual age in Chapter 12 Along the way we will make frequent references to privacy We found reason to mention it in almost every chapter of this book
 This surprised us As the next chapter demonstrates we even found reasons to worry about privacy while looking at a box of cereal
 

 Chapter 3


 The Customer in Context

 Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name

 Cheers theme song 

 Retail changed a lot last century It started with shops on Main Street where merchants recognized many customers as neighbors and treated them that way It culminated with the birth of internet commerce where retailers could scale and improve efficiency without any human contact at all
 Along the way something got lost something that is hard to recover in these modern times where you can be a global merchant from your home office
 Sam Lessin is nostalgic for those earlier more personal times It might be because his Facebook Timeline says he was born in 1914 This is puzzling because as head of the Facebook Identity Product Group he runs Facebook Timeline and he doesnt look too many days over 30 But he sounds like he might have been around in 1914 when he says Something got lost along the way something personal that mattered
 He thinks the very technology that has so dramatically reduced close personal service may now be used to restore it He believes Facebook Timeline might be part of the solution despite his awareness that the platforms ongoing tweaks and changes annoy many users 
 The way he sees it Timeline is a work in progress It will eventually allow Facebook to recapture some sense of those folksier days through the social network where it advertisers and users can all get to understand each other online and enhance the other participants experience 
 Its a challenge not just for Facebook but for any online company trying to personalize retailing in a facetoscreen world The convenience of todays transactionbased retailing is obvious but if you are among those of us who wish we could be known by more than a data trail of our purchase and payment histories Lessin and others have a long way to go before most people will feel trusting and comfortable not to mention warm and fuzzy
 Lessin believes contextual technologies can improve the retail experience as they will allow sellers to understand far more about customers as individuals and thereby enable them to help people in the same way the hometown merchant once did 
 Facebook like other online platforms wants to build a system that anticipates your needs and can offer you help at the moment you want it and then not bother you with anything once you have made a decision
 Lessin is thinking in terms that are deeper and more meaningful than the keywordbased messages currently being pushed at us His vision has a long long way to go before it becomes a reality 
 Vidya Narayanan who works for crosstown rival Google agrees with Lessin Shes a network architect who spends part of her time on mobile context awareness and personalization More than that she was part of the research team that got Qualcomm a world leader in mobile technologies to develop Gimbal the leading contextual platform for Android and iOS mobile software developers
 We are just now learning to take baby steps in helping users All we can do now is little stuff such as contextual calendars and maps that understand your preferred route to the airport she says
 Ultimately we want a lot more We want online sites to know how to treat us in the same way Sam the bartender in the old TV sitcom Cheers treated his customers When his regulars walked through the door Sam poured them their usual drink without asking what they wanted As he handed them the drink he asked questions that showed he understood what was going on in their personal and work lives
 This is a lot better than telling you what people who bought the book you just selected on Amazon also liked It takes a lot of baby steps to get from there to the Cheers retail experience
 Yet a great many of the worlds biggest and most successful companies are taking baby steps at a rapidly escalating rate They are not just the usual internet behemoths you might expect but also traditional mainstream retailers like WalMart NFL teams like the New England Patriots and spunky little startups helping winemakers meet more upscale consumers
 Yes they collect data on you they use locationbased technology to know where you are and where youre headed and sensors to see what you are looking at It sounds a bit like the opening line in the popular TV series Person of Interest which begins with the declaration You are being watched The government has a secret system a machine that spies on you every hour of every day
 Lessin sees it differently To him telling Facebook or other sites information about yourself is like investing in a global data bank The more you tell the world about yourself the more the world can give you what you want he says
 Still many people will find this chilling While we most certainly see why we believe this shift is inevitable The internet companies you encounter will know more and more about you and your preferences Trying to stop your personal information from being collected and used at this point is tantamount to trying to stop a tsunami by standing on a beach and punching it 
 This is true for you as a customer in the physical world as well You will soon find nearly as much contextual technology in brick and mortar retail as you do online The technology you carry into the store with you will talk with the technology in the store That loyalty card in your pocket or on your keychain is becoming a mobile technology enabler It has even found its way into the stands of the football stadiumperhaps the most popular part of this invisible information exchange is that it helps loyal fans get their beer faster
 The Contextual Fan


 The NFL is the worlds most lucrative professional sports organization It took in 88 billion in revenuein 2012 But there was a problem Leaguewide instadium attendance has been shrinking by an average of 2 percent per year according to insiders Stadium fans represent the most profitable segment of NFL revenues Its not just the steeply priced tickets its also the beverages and food as well as all those caps tee shirts andsouvenirbling
 Where are the fans going Theyre not moving over to a competing sport many of which are also experiencing similar fan base erosion in parks and arenas It isnt even the economy which has been treating many fans like a linebacker treats a quarterback
 In fact their biggest competitor is also one of footballs most lucrative allies HDTV Broadcast of course pays big bucks for licensing rights but theres less profit in it than getting a fan to come to the stadium The teams do not share in ad revenues with network broadcastsand they dont get to sell viewers anything
 Each year a few more people stay home or go to local taverns to watch games on big screens Multiple cameras and clever audio letTV viewers see the game better from their living rooms or barstools than from the best stadium seats Besides you can get a beer and a burger faster and cheaper and the lines for the bathrooms are a lot shorter
 Beer and soft drinks are a big deal to the NFL They represent 70 percent of all revenue during a game and they provide a high profit margin So each time a fan gets a fresh cold one at the local tavern the NFL is thrown for a slight loss on the bottom line
 Almost by definition the guys who run the NFL are a competitive bunch They understand that when they keep getting thrown for a loss of 2 percent each year they need to change strategy
 The surprise to us was to learn they see the solution in online and contextual technologies Starting in September 2013 season ticket holders were able to see the game better on their tablets and iPhones inside the stadium than at home Best of all they could get theirburgers and beers faster when theyre atGillette Stadium home of the New England Patriots the winningest team in football over the last decadeThe NFL is using the Patriots as a test case for the entire league If it works it will be phased into all 32 NFL stadiums in the next few years
 The Patriots may seem like an odd choice For years theyve sold out every seat at every home game They have a season ticket waiting list of 60000 almost one faninwaiting for every seat College students who are on the waiting list today may be grandparents before they get to the top of the list
 So why the Patriots It turns out that in the NFL the Pats have been the flagship for introducing online technologiesJonathan Kraft is president of the Kraft Group owners of the Patriots and as cochairman of the Leagues digital media committee he has been entrusted to explore ways to enhance fan experience through technology
 Kraft understands both the advantages and the challenges of stadium events There is still nothing like the thrill of a live game he says but we realize we have to match what people get at home and then make the instadium experience that much better
 Kraft turned to Fred Kirsch the Patriots vice president of content whose job is to use technologies to bring fans and players closer together He has a history of doing just that He started hisKirschWordsblog in the mid1990s It became the first teamsanctioned blog and then the first authorized to liveblog an NFL game He was also the first to podcast a game These days KirschWords gets about 200000 downloads per game
 The Pats keep innovating They post uncut versions of player press conferences on the teamwebsite They are hyperactive on social networks and have produced a whole suite of mobile apps
 All this has globalized the Patriots fan base perhaps more than any other team Today far more people follow the Patriots online than see them compete in stadiums each year
 Kirsch contractedEnterasys Networks to realize the objective of using online technology to enhance the instadium experience The first step which started in 2008 was to wire the entire stadium making the Wifi network so rocksolid that 70000 fans could simultaneously go online and watch the same replay or livestream without even a hint of latency
 This was something that previously had not been done and it required an expensive and complicated doubledensity system Completed in 2010 it is used on average by 12000 fans at each home game So far it has performed flawlessly HD cameras were placed throughout the stadium to provide exclusive livestream footage A single camera was designated to follow the Patriots charismatic quarterback Tom Bradyduring every moment of a game
 This wasnt like checking in on FoursquareAs Vala Afshar Enterasyss CMO explains The idea was to let fans use their smart phones and tablets to experience things that were not previously possible and not possible outside of the stadium Gillettes Wifi is intended to give fans a better experience than they can have at the local pub It also provides video that equals or surpasses HDTV
 By 2012 the Enterasys network was ready for live fan testing Season ticket holders and fans in elite seats who bring mobile devices with them are treated to six livestream views of the game plus replays They can use the Wifi to tweet or check other games as well
 But 2012 was just the start You might say it was the year when the baby learned to crawl In 2013 the Patriots system took its first actual steps by letting premium fans use their mobile devices to order drinks and food while sitting in their seats through mobile apps that also allow them to pay by credit card
 Food and drink arent delivered to fan seats Football fans are very intense They dont want to miss a single play and they dont like passing hot dogs or beers to the guy sitting in the middle of the row Kraft says So the Patriots have set up an express line Fans get alerted when their order is ready They zip up grab their order and get back to their seat missing as little of the game as possible
 Fans can also check the mobile app to find out which restroom lines are the shortest a concern that can become even more urgent than the need for fresh beer The Pats use locationbased technologies so they know where you are seated in the stands and which restroom and concession stands are nearest to you
 From baby steps the Pats management hopes to be jogging later in the 20132014 season Thats when the Gillettesystem starts getting deeply contextual They are gathering data on the eating and drinking habits of participating fans They know when a season ticket holder is attending and what that customers buying habits are during a game so they can start to predict who will be ordering what at a particular moment in every game Perhaps they will start having fans preorder before they even get to the stadium
 All of this will help the Pats predict inventory They will know in advance how much of each item they are likely to sell and when they need to be preparing or pouring The fans are getting a frictionless order and the Pats are getting a return on their investment by reducing costs and serving their best customers faster
 Besides migrating to other NFL stadiums the system will also be used for rock concerts and other events atGillette Stadium Of course other pro sports teams will follow the Patriots lead as will other concert and conference producers 
 RightTime Experiences


 Although some of us may share Lessins nostalgia for simpler times we simultaneously enjoy the benefits of these new contextual times Buying something online may often feel impersonal but it is also convenient and often less costly 
 While there is no equivalent to Sam the Cheers bartender just yet contextual technology is inching us toward a time when our interaction with online sites will feel as natural and personal as yesterdays visits to the shops on Main Street 
 This is not the case only for online shopping It can also significantly change our relationships with big brand stores located thousands of miles from our homes Social networks are part of the solution New ones such as Highlight the locationbased social network based we mentioned previously can alert a store when a customer is approaching 
 On a visit to New York City Robert Scoble posted on Highlight that he was going to Bloomingdales to buy a certain brand of jeans As he walked through the main entrance a sales representative knew he was headed her way because she had seen his Highlight post She recognized him by his user ID photo Through Highlights messaging feature she escorted Scoble to the jeans he had mentioned
 Although not quite remarkable this anecdote is indicative of a new level of personal connection one that uses online contextual technologies to inch realworld merchants closer to customers in a memorable and potentially scalable way It also shows how contextual technologies can improve a retailers understanding of who is influential in the online world
 Readers familiar with Scoble would agree he is no slave to fashion Bloomingdales could also easily see he is not among their most frequent customers However such technologies make it easier to expand and personalize VIP treatment by expanding their selection criteria to accommodate those who are known to be influential in online communities
 Using various combinations of the five contextual forces forwardthinking marketers are shifting focus away from mass messages and more into what Maribel Lopez founder of Lopez Research calls righttime experiences where mobile technologies deliver customers the right information at precisely the moment of need
 Weve all had righttime experiencesthe moment when we caught a homerun baseball from the bleachers shared a first kiss on a beach were motivated by a wise teacher or saw a sparkling celebrity as she emerged from a limousine
 Contextual technology allows marketers to give more and more customers and prospects righttime experiences Theres a Mickey Mouse organization that wants to do precisely that for your kids
 Magic Bands at Magic Mountain


 Disneyland and Disney World two of the ultimate familygetaway destinations will soon offer sensors in a throwaway wearable device 
 MagicBand is a plastic wristband that was awaiting FCC approval when we investigated in March 2013 According to the filing it is a smart disposable batteryoperated wireless bracelet coded with admission privileges and containing sensors The first name of the user appears on each band which is expected to eventually replace tickets badges and passes at all Disney sites worldwide The device contains authorized credit card information so your family can enjoy its day with abandon and free from the distraction of constant requests for Moms credit card
 Even though the customers and applications differ Gillette Stadium and Disneyland are using contextual technologies in a similar way They are improving the customer experience within a geographically constrained area This phenomenon called geofencing is a contextual technique that sets a virtual perimeter around a realworld place 
 We think geofencing will be used in many ways to create more righttime experiences in the real world 
 Neither of us is a frequent visitor to amusement parks or football stadiums but there is a geofence located near us that fulfills one of our favorite righttime experiences
 Wining Tourists


 As we wrote this chapter in March 2013 a small analystconsulting firm called VinTank was starting to virtually erect a geofence around each of the 450 wineries that make up one of our favorite destination areas Napa County epicenter of the California wine industry
 According to founderCEO Paul Mabray VinTank is positioned at the intersection of the wine industry and technology By no coincidence he and his business partner chief technology officer James Jory are both geeks who love wine
 As an analyst firm VinTank was early and strong into social media demonstrating far greater interest in understanding what wine lovers were saying rather than figuring how to use social media to broadcast marketing messages In fact it did more listening to online wine conversations than anyone which made them smarter in many ways
 In 2012 VinTank monitored aggregated and analyzed about 350 million online wine conversationsabout a million every day From that they extracted 50 million conversations relevant to brand region or variety
 This helped them build a massive database of individuals and their wine preferences By February 2013 they had records on 135 million people who had expressed their wine tastes in social networks In an average month VinTank expands the list by about 500000 conversational tidbits 
 If you have paid north of 100 for a premium cabernet VinTank has probably retained your name and the online locations youve visited which they shared with wineryclients looking for premium prospects
 If you once tweeted that you enjoy guzzling TwoBuck Chuck on a street corner dont worry Your secret is safe because they expunged you from the database
 VinTank also has watched what you have posted on photo and locationbased social sites Every time a visitor posts an Instagram shot at a winery or checks in on Foursquare or reports heavy traffic on Highway 29 Napas central artery VinTank captures the data on where that person was and what she was doing
 VinTank arguably knows more about individual wine tastes than any other organization and Napa County is both their home base and their strong suit They also know what wine clubs youve joined what restaurants you have visited in Napa and where you bought your last case of wine They know what tasting rooms you visited and what you posted about each
 Based on all this data VinTank gives wine enthusiasts a numerical rating It is similar to how Klout ranks social media influencers but it seems to be based on more data Its also in realtime When you post that smiling photo of you with your friends touching glasses in a toast VinTank captures it as it goes live
 In 2011 it dawned on Mabray and Jory that there might be greater value to wineries than just using this data for analyst reports The closer they looked the greater promise they saw Better still contextual technologies removed any barriers they might have faced to moving from just an analyst firm into a more lucrative marketing service
 The idea was simple Every year about 5 million people visit Napa If VinTank knows where people stay what restaurants they have previously liked and what wines they have enjoyed they can predict with high accuracy what wines and places people may be interested in In Napa those wineries and restaurants are likely to already be VinTank customers
 In March 2013 VinTank started building a geofence around 25 winery clients They are steadily expanding until they have geofenced the entire wine region Craig Camp a partner at Cornerstone Cellars a small wine producer in Yountville was among the first to sign up for VinTanks pilot project
 We dreamed about this kind of stuff years ago but we just didnt have the technology until VinTank put it together Camp says Our wine is priced from 40 to 120 per bottle We need to identify the consumer who is a candidate for our upscale line and that is not always so easy to do as they walk through the door How does Cornerstone separate the jug lovers from those who savor Opus One but would like to find something a little different
 When an Opus One lover is driving staying or dining nearby VinTank alerts Cornerstone The winery sends a personalized enote or text message inviting the visitors party to a private tasting of reserved stock
 This is not just geofencing at its best its also a great example of what contextual marketers call Pinpoint Marketingthe ability to avoid noise and send appropriate signals to precisely the prospects you want with a deal they will find attractive We will discuss this in more detail in Chapter 11
 What VinTank is doing for Napa has the potential to help other destination merchants such as restaurants amusement parks hotels and museumsany leisure time destinationsto find potential customers and filter out those who are nearby but not likely to be a good match
 The magic is that over time wherever you go more people will not only know your name they will be pretty accurate in knowing how they can help youand leave you alone if they cant 
 This increased personalization and concurrent lack of privacy of course is going to be uncomfortable for some people at first but we believe that will change over time Marc Andreessen one of Silicon Valleys most respected thinkers and investors predicts merchants will understand who you are and what you want by the time you arrive Today this may feel a little bizarre Andreessen says but 20 years from now it will be bizarre if you walk into a store and the store doesnt know who you are At the rate of current change we think 20 years may be a bit conservative
 Uber Experience


 Uber was originally called UberCab except that the startup kept getting ceaseanddesist orders from municipalities for operating without taxi licenses Uber as it is now called is a locationbased transportation service that will pick you up anywhere in most major North American urban areas as well as a growing number of the worlds major cities usually in less than 10 minutes of your text message
 They always find you The driver sees your location because your phone is showing up on her mobile apps map as she heads toward youand you watch the Uber car as it heads in your direction Uber vehicles are usually luxury sedans or new SUVs They are almost always dentfree and spotless
 When you arrive at your destination you just hop out Uber has your credit card information and the 20 percent tip is included Drivers are reputed to be extremely courteous They make about 30 percent of the fare far better than at a taxi service and you get to rate drivers on the app in the same way you rate restaurants on Yelp or sellers on eBay You can choose the driver based on either location or ranking But behave yourselfthe driver also gets to rate you on your conduct as a passenger
 Andreessen told CNET he wished he had invested in the company Uber is software that eats taxis he said We agree We think Uber is a textbook example of what we mean by a righttime experience 
 If you use it regularly we think it will evolve into an even bettertime experience Uber keeps data on where you are when you text them They are building an anticipatory system that watches your patterns and over time understands that you have a pattern of requesting a car from a given place at a particular time They can be there at the instant you want them perhaps before you even send a text message On a cold or rainy night or when you find yourself in a tough neighborhood it is comforting to think you can get your ride before you freeze or get mugged 
 Uber may have originated the idea of letting customers autopay for realworld products and services but the concept has started to spread The Apple App Store has a feature called EasyPay which lets registered users walk into an Apple store use the app to scan a bar code to see reviews and product specifications click to pay for the product with their credit card on file at iTunes and then leave without ever talking to a clerk You get your receipt by email
 For us this scenario presents an interesting twist Contextual technologies are helping online merchants get more personal while it is helping brickandmortar businesses get less personal We support both so long as the customer gets to decide which they prefer
 Attention on WalMart Shoppers


 In January 2013 we attended CES in part to see what retailers were doing with contextual technologies We were amazed at how sensors were getting into more and more consumer products
 The company that most impressed us was PrimeSense an Israeli organization with offices in Silicon Valley The firm has been the world leader in 3D sensors for yearsPrimeSense puts the magic into many games including Microsoft Kinect where the sensors read your kids gestures and cool dance steps 
 PrimeSense is adding new contextual functionality to a wide variety of familiar products such as TVs smartphones tablets Bluetooth devices cameras and autos The sensors see with great accuracy and can also tell how hard you are pressing when you touch an object
 According to president and founder Aviad Maizels PrimeSense likes to see itself as the miracle ingredient inside other companies products When you dont understand how something works we hope PrimeSense is the secret he said He showed us a sensor set targeted for mobile device makers that was as small as a stick of gum PrimeSense sensors also have a great deal to do with what makes Google Glass such a breakthrough product
 At CES PrimeSense was sequestered in a private hotel suite where it showed off what a few startup partners were doing with their sensors All were impressive but a tiny Argentinian company called Shopperception downright dazzled us
  They make spatial recognition tools for brickandmortar products and brands Early testers include WalMart the worlds largest physical retailer and Heineken maker of the worlds eighth most popular beer These are both mainstream brands that usually dont embrace new technologies until others have tested and refined them The fact that such established brands are already road testing contextual technologies confirms our sense that the new Age of Context is imminent
 Just like with the Patriots and VinTank Shopperceptions use of loyalty programs is key to customer participation On the merchant side unprecedented data is being generated on what actually happens at the point of touch between shopper and product
 Shopperception installs panels containing PrimeSense 3D sensors on the ceiling directly over a retail product section The sensors see what every shopper touches or reads where they stop to look what actually goes into the shopping cart and how long each customer spends conducting any one of these actions
 The sensors mask the identity of each user The cameras can recognize the gender of the shopper but they dont capture their identity Ariel Di Stefano Shopperception cofounder insists Our policy is to respect personal privacy always
 The idea according to Di Stefano is to modernize the primitive way data has been captured for more than a century Traditionally a clerk has collected most of it with a clicker and a clipboard
 Shopperception lets retailers understand a lot more While they may not be video recording what any one person is doing the sensors provide granular data on what people collectively do giving the store a deep and wide understanding not previously attainable Where do most people standing in front of cereal brands look Where do they reach What catches their attention How often do they buy the first item they touch What sort of incentive will get a customer to switch
 In the old days of the local store a shopkeeper could observe his best customers and adjust stock and displays accordingly But for big brands that sell myriad products on millions of square feet of retail displays in scores of countries it is a daunting task to understand what happens at the point where shoppers touch inventory 
 The data being collected is expected to help stores understand customer behavior so they can better predict the likely effect of changes It lets retailers fully understand the value of every inch of store real estate and how position and location impact customer behavior
 Shopperception enables the worlds largest retailer to do precisely that with enhanced loyalty programs that use contextual technology to know when one of its best customers is there Based on previous buying patterns and the route the shopper usually takes through the store the customer will get special offers on items he usually buys or WalMart thinks he might want
 For example when a shopper touches a boxor merely looks at itan iPad screen installed on the shelf displays a promotional offer for the box being touched or perhaps for a competing product To get the deal all the customer has to do is toss the offered product into his shopping cart and the cash register which is part of the system will adjust the price at checkout
 We think the loyalty program will take on new dimensions in the Age of Context Additionally such incentive programs can deal with the responsibility of meeting shopper privacy wishes People will understand that when they opt in they are trading their personal data for better deals and perhaps shorter lines
 Some people may not want to do this If they do not want WalMart to be a place where everyone knows their name all they have to do is opt out of the loyalty program to keep their privacybut then they will have to pay the full retail price
 Shopperception is not the only contextual company that wants to watch you and gather data while you shop The online publication Verge reported on New YorkbasedIMRSVs sensorbased data collecting camera called Cara which they rent to any retailer for 40 a month Cara can determine your age gender and whether you are happy or sad from 25 feet away It is in use in the Reebok store on Manhattans Fifth Avenue 
 The store is using it to collect data on what customers look at and touch on the shoe wall The store says it is trying to better understand the customer experience The vendor says that it wants to put a Cara next to every cash register ad and retail display in the world
 Back in the earlier times that Facebooks Lessin referred to so fondly that is what shopkeepers and bartenders did It was called knowing your customers and most people loved it Now instead of someone looking you in the eye knowing your drink preference and asking how your work is going sensors and data are being used to understand you
 In that light its easy to join Lessin and yearn for simpler times but retail will not turn back Personal relationships cannot scale to global levels and it will take a great many small steps before most people are fully comfortable with the coming contextual age Those who are already the best customers are the ones most likely to embrace the benefits of context At every wave of new technology some people opt out They choose not to drive or fly We recall a court case involving a teacher who banned students from using Google instead of libraries because searching online was cheating That was less than ten years ago
 The Ice Cream Incentive


 In the case of retail merchants have long understood how to use incentives to gain engagement
 Marc Andreessen whose venture firm Andreessen Horowitz has invested more dollars in contextual technologies than most any other earlyphase firm sees the best retail strategy online and off as something called free ice cream
 It is the marketing concept that enables you to gain users even as you refine earlyphase technology All you have to do he explains is offer something so tasty cool and sweet that most people just cant resist Its so good they just have to tell their friends who will of course try it and tell other friends and so on
 Andreessen is actually a free ice cream pioneer As a young entrepreneur in the mid1990s he founded Netscape the first popular web browser To get everyday people to use Netscape he offered the browser for free Once Netscape had a lot of end users it charged businesses that wanted access to those early web surfers
 The approach has worked well for many of the companies that followedGoogle Twitter Facebook LinkedIn YouTube to name a few Contextual loyalty programs are yet another example of Andreessens free ice cream tactic because they create righttime experiences for football and amusement park visitors as well as adultbeverage drinkers Contextual free ice cream is delivered in many flavors and in many places
 Among the most awkward for holders of free ice cream is behind the wheel of one of the priciest of products that is not free We refer of course to the family car
 

 Chapter 4


 The Road to Context

  If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has we would all be driving 25 cars that got 1000 MPG

 Anonymous often wrongly attributed to Bill Gates

 In 2005 Bob Lutz then vice chairman of GM became the highestranking executive blogger He turned to new media to fight old media In a 2008 FastCompany interview with Shel Israel Lutz said he decided to take what was then considered a radical step because he felt GM was the victim of a media bias and he wanted a venue where he could talk directly with the carbuying public 
 Lutz would become a regular contributor to GMs Fastlane blog where he often argued the automakers case It unquestionably reversed media coverage of GM Lutz said 
 The story was impressive back then but upon reflection it only demonstrated that the charismatic Lutz could make a good case on what was the most advanced communication tool available in 2005 Consider how the newer tools of sensors data location and mobility have changed the game just for auto executives not to mention the entire automotive industry
 In February 2013 John M Broder a respected New York Times reporter often assigned to the White House took a Tesla Model S an elegant electric sedan for a test drive from Washington DC to New England He had planned to complete his ride in Boston but instead it was ingloriously aborted in Connecticut where the Tesla ran out of power and was towed away on the back of a truck He photographed the powersapped Tesla and reported having had a very bad experience in his Times review
 Like Lutz Elon Musk Tesla founder and CEO chose to blog his side of the story Although Lutz had to count on his own credibility and persuasive abilities when writing his blog Musk had a credible eyewitness to everything that happened between Broder and the Tesla Like most luxury cars today the Tesla collects and stores data on where it has been and what happened to it in a littleknown device called an Event Data Recorder EDR
 The EDR is similar to the black box on an airplane EDRs are being popularized by free ice cream offers Progressive Insurance offers customers a discount if they install one and allow the insurer to access data The National Highway Safety Council is lobbying to make them mandatory in new cars Most people seem to be unaware that they exist
 The question is not yet settled by a court ruling but the general legal consensus is that police will be able to subpoena car logs the same way they now subpoena phone records An EDR can prove where a car resembling the one in a bank surveillance video was at the time of a heist
 Musk used the Tesla EDR to provide forensic evidence of Broders road trip He posted graphs that showed wide variations between what Broder reported and what the car recorded Musk charged that Broder did not factually represent Tesla technology and that Broder worked very hard to force our car to stop running
 Margaret Sullivan as public editor of the de facto OpEd page ombudsman for the Times concluded that Broders review contained problems with precision and judgment
 Todays car is entirely different than the product of just five years ago says K Venkatesh Prasad senior technical leader for Ford Open Innovation and a member of the FordTechnology Advisory Board Today the car is a cognitive device 
 Many people do not yet realize it but the modern car is as much a contextual tool as a smart phone isonly a lot bigger 
 Not only can it defend itself against harsh critics but it can also protect its passengers from hazards and inconvenience all while keeping them connected and entertained As Broder painfully learned todays cars keep logs of their performance and understand the behavior of each of its regular drivers
 Cars have become personal And they get to know you better over time They not only adjust seat positions and mirrors automatically but soon theyll also know your preferences in music service stations dining spots and hotels They know your usual routes in the context of time and day of the week They know when you are headed home and soon theyll be able to remind you to stop at the market to get a dessert for dinner 
 In a significant advance cars are also starting to talk with each other in ways that may prevent collisions Sensors will soon be used to detect if you have been drinking alcohol excessively and advise against driving or perhaps prevent you from operating your own vehicle In the future the car may navigate itself home while the driver sleeps it off Some cars will have features that protect themselves from thievesand even certain family members 
 Fellow Travelers


 We spoke to a lot of automotive people including authorized representatives at Toyota Audi Mercedes Ford GM Volkswagen Lexus and Tesla As an industry they are all headed down the contextual highway They are all embracing each of our five forces and are investing many millions of dollars in contextual cars All new cars even lowend models will soon have a broad array of contextual functionality
 Reasons for these changes range from safety to the changing lifestyle of younger generations who want their cars integrated with their mobile phones and wearable devicesif they want cars at all 
 Everywhere we looked we saw sensorsand in many cases we assume they saw us Masumi Nagai group vice president of the eToyota Division of North America says the average Toyota contains about 200 sensors and he predicts the number will continue to increase Sensors make cars smarter and passengers safer he says
 Sensors today play a role in just about all aspects of a cars performance safety and security They report when your tires are low and when you need maintenance In some cars they warn when objects are in your blind spots they sense water on windshields and start wipers at the appropriate speed They help some cars to selfpark and some warn when you are drifting over lane markers
 Sensors without question save lives They make the modern contextual car smart enough to act before drivers are even aware of small or lifethreatening changes They can tell if leaves a darting child or a turning vehicle are the cause of a shadow crossing your cars path
 Crash Prevention


 The ability to see whats around a car in any direction can save lives as Vic Gundotra a Google senior vice president dramatically learned He was driving his 2010 S Class MercedesBenz at 45 mph on a chilly morning in January 2011 when as he related it in a Mercedes video ad I turned for a very brief moment I never saw my traffic lane stop 
 Gundotra heard a few little beeps as his Mercedes took over its own braking system and brought the car to a full skidfree haltjust inches behind the bumper of the car in front of him He was unhurt as were the people whose car he nearly struck His car performed faster than he could possibly have he said
 Most new luxury cars have similar advanced features Historically as they get refined these enhancements become less expensive It is only a matter of time we think before anticollision systems are standard equipment on every car In some places governments may require them or insurance carriers may give car owners incentives to buy cars that feature them
 Both of Scobles cars a 2010 Toyota Prius and a 2011 Sienna have frontfacing phasedetection radar He says hell never own another car without it He too believes these devices have saved him from serious problems Not only are sensors faster than drivers they are also smarter than thieves
 Carjack Pooled


 Nothing might look more tempting to a car thief than a nice shiny new Tesla parked at the curb or in the shadows of a parking garage These guys have tools that slide down your window slot to trip locks The best still know how to jimmy a door handle
 Except the Tesla has no door handle to jimmy and no lock to trip Instead the Tesla has a sensor in the drivers door that sees who is approaching and recognizes authorized drivers When it sees one its door latch pushes out like headlights do in some cars If you arent on that Teslas AList the door wont open for youshort of blowtorching your way inand that will trip the heatdetection alarm
 All new highend cars have advanced antitheft systems although perhaps not all are as foolproof as Teslas If the car does somehow get ripped off or borrowed by an unauthorized family member the car can tell you where it is through tweets or text messages which owners or services can then convey to police
 Sometimes vehicles can make dangerous carjackers look like fools That was the case in 2009 when Jose Ruiz was chatting with a friend inside his Chevrolet Tahoe in a Visalia California parking lot Suddenly a man with a sawedoff shotgun approached demanding valuables and the keys to the SUV 
 Ruiz almost gladly obliged He knew something the thief didnt His Tahoe was equipped with a GM OnStar system the granddaddy of all automobile remote communications services The 2009 version was the first to provide a Stolen Vehicle Slowdown feature
 As the thief drove off OnStar started signaling its location to OnStar operators who then alerted police They soon spotted the stolen truck and began what started off as hot pursuit but after a few seconds cooled down dramatically 
 OnStar service operators remotely disabled the Tahoes gas pedal About 16 minutes after the operators were notified the SUV ground to a halt The robber then bolted on footrunning directly into a swimming pool where police fished him out and then cuffed him
 OnStar was formed in 1995 as a collaboration between GM Electronic Data Systems and Hughes Electronics Corp Its first customer was GM which introduced the service in 1996 in highend Cadillacs The carmakerand its customersliked it so much that GM bought the company making it a subsidiary 
 Each year its systems become more refined Last year it premiered video chat through a dashboard screen Over 6 million people subscribe to it paying a monthly fee Its available in all GM vehicles and has been licensed to Volkswagen Acura and Audi It gets a little less expensive every year
 OnStar uses lots of sensors and has often introduced features that other companies eventually emulate It was among the first to allow handsfree voicecommand technology for phone calling It pioneered many safety features and can sense that a collision occurred and if your airbags inflated Then it checks to see if you are conscious If not it calls 911 on your behalf providing your precise location via GPS sensors 
 Sensors also can help drivers become more aware of their own driving shortcomings GM is experimenting with 3D sensors that will see if a driver is dozing 
 In the future the car may also connect with personal wristband monitoring devices that measure such health functions as heart rate body temperature and perspiration If you are experiencing physical problems the car will connect with your smartphone and use that combined information to figure out where you should go to get help 
 Other wearable devices have sensors that can monitor blood sugar and alcohol levels When connected to the car these devices could refuse to allow the car to start until a diabetic eats an apple or an imbiber sobers up
 All the auto people we spoke with were focused initially on using contextual technology to improve safety and security From a pragmatic perspective carmakers understand that people will adopt new technology fastest when it ensures protection for the people and property they hold dear
 Automotive Clouds


 The connected car may travel many routes in the nearterm future Each requires that the car gather and store lots of data most of which will be aggregated automatically without the drivers knowledge or permission 
 Carmakers are forming data storage alliances with cloud storage organizations such as Rackspace and Microsoft Azure Lexus plans to build a global ring of data centers In short automakers are planning to permanently store data in the cloud and they will be storing a lot more data than you may think
 For end users this data collection can be useful Your family car will know more than just when its time to change the oil It will understand your preferences patterns and quirks Without any user input it will know who just slipped behind the wheel and will adjust the seat mirrors temperature music stations and volume accordingly 
 If you want to loan your car to a friend youll be able to give instructions to the vehicle authorizing the guest and imposing any restrictions related to how far or fast that person can go and at what time the car must be returnedor it will turn off
 Ford offers a mobile app that seems designed for remote parental control of kids at the wheel MyKey encourages safety by reminding teens to wear seat belts and it sets limits on audio level and speed In a future version we are told MyKeyregulated vehicles will decelerate in the same way OnStar slows purloined vehicles The car can be turned off if the driver goes beyond authorized geographic bounds or breaks curfew
 Beyond such benefits lurk many complex questions that no one seems to have yet answered
 Insurance Could carriers demand to see annual data logs so they can reward good drivers with discounts and discourage bad drivers with higher rates Progressive uses a free ice cream tactic to accomplish this today but could this become a requirement for all drivers Is better safety worth less privacy Who should decide the driver carrier or government regulator
 Law Enforcement One of the most disturbing aspects of the Age of Context is who owns data being collected on individuals Tied to that is the question of who has access to that data including law enforcement officials
 What about plain old speeding On a road trip in January 2013 the alwaysconnected Scoble was using Glympse a contextual app that lets others see your location One of Scobles Glympsers remotely snapped a shot of his dashboard revealing his speed at 99 mph Could police use that photo to issue him a citation Should they
 Civil Suits Consider a divorce case where alleged infidelity is an issue Can an aggrieved party demand to see the GPS record that shows where a spouse was parked at a particular time
 Reselling Can someone demand to see data that shows how well or abusively the seller drove a car This would be more useful to a prospective buyer than just knowing how many miles the car has traveled 
 Revenuers Can the IRS demand to see the EDR data log during an audit in which a drivers travel and entertainment expenses are under scrutiny
 Involuntary Scrutiny In March 2013 Yahoo Autos reported some federal officials wanted to install EDR black boxes in cars to record accident data the same way they record flight data in planes 
 The Golden Gate Bridge has eliminated human toll takers Instead it requires drivers to attach a FastTrak sensor box to their windshield which automatically deducts a payment from a registered credit card as the car passes through the tollgate 
 To catch violators the automated tollgate takes license plate pictures Offenders get email notifications and can pay the toll online There has been virtually no public controversy about FastTrak so far although it establishes that a particular vehicle was in a certain place at a specific time Should use of such data be valid for alibis and prosecutions
 Navigating these ongoing and complex issues will likely set privacy and public safety on a collision course To ensure one could diminish the other We wont attempt to guess how these matters ultimately will be resolved but we are certain the resolution like that of similar issues will involve time extended debate and compromise
 States have been debating motorcycle and bicycle helmet laws for almost 50 years Currently 21 states still do not require protection for one or both of these 
 Wisconsin passed the first seat belt requirement in 1961 Today 49 states require them New Hampshire is the remaining holdout Perhaps as a touch of macabre irony the states motto Live free or die is inscribed on all license plates
 Phones at the Epicenter


 For carmakers one of the most difficult realities is the notion that the phone not the car itself is likely to be the hub of the drivers contextual network 
 Some carmakers have been attempting to make the car the central hub for every drivers personal technology Some have been planning to establish app stores where they would market authorized thirdparty technology thus creating a lucrative sidebusiness The idea is that upon entering your car you could download new apps and updates to your phone A few carmakers started offering 4G Wifi for drivers trapped in 3G zones
 After all some manufacturers argued people spend 10 percent of their lives in cars and downloading would be easier via the larger device
 The carashub model seems like a bad idea to us Our phones are with us nearly 100 percent of the time and most people are already accustomed to using them for downloads Having a second hub in their lives adds an unneeded layer of complexity and a potential for incompatibility We think it is far better to have cars that are agnostic as to operating systems and that enable us to use what we already have in the mobile devices we carry
 For example when we get into our cars our Spotifycom music should automatically move from our phone to our car speaker Google Calendar already knows where you need to go and it should automatically tell your cars navigation system what it knows Perhaps Google Maps will just move from your phone to your dashboard screen where it will eat less battery life and be easier and safer to see The same should be the case with other mobile apps
 Car internet communication systems are going to need to be compatible with the personal technology of all passengers or car makers will end up as isolated data silos If we have to enter and store duplicate data in our phones and our vehicles its a recipe for inefficiency and waste
 Our phones are also better hubs because each user gets to choose one operating system to use everywhere In 2010 Shel and Paula Israel took a road trip testdriving a 2011 Ford Escape Hybrid It featured a SYNC automated system that worked on voice command and managed sound navigation and climate control to make their trip safer and more enjoyable 
 It was a fine system except that SYNC ran on Windows and the Israels were only familiar with Apple devices While the phone was compatible with SYNC it felt like a Windows operating system which the Israels had not used in years During the trip they had to pull over several times to figure out how to work the navigation system and even the radio They would have preferred to have their Apple software seamlessly transferred from phone to car and feel like the system they normally used 
 Smartphone and operating system compatibility should be the users choice or so it seems to us The killer issue however is speed of implementation It takes an automaker as long as eight years to deliver a new car from concept to showroom At best they do it in three A mobile phone app takes about eight months 
 This may still be an undecided issue among carmakers the next time you buy a new car It is not an issue that most people consider when car shopping but it is one that will very much influence their daily experience after purchase
 The Personalized Auto


 The good news is that many major manufacturers are abandoning their carsashubs strategy and recognizing that the phone should serve as the epicenter of the contextual hub At least thats what we hear from representatives at Ford GM Audi and Toyota 
 In the long term Ford is toying with the concept of making just three basic car models luxury intermediate and economy Each would be stripped of all accessories and users would select just the accessories they want Ironically the new program will be similar to how cars were sold up through the 1950s
 Fords Prasad champions this concept but he isnt thinking retro Hes looking at other technology hardware devices Apple rolls a million identical iPads off the line and they are sold to one million people Within an hour each is personalized and unique from all the others We want to do that with the Fords of the future he says
 Of course iPads are personalized to a large degree by software and this will also be true of the contextual car And the collection of software designed for incar use is growing
 For example Twist is callahead software that sees where you are and knows where you are heading as well as knowing the driving conditions en route It sends a text message to your next appointment while you keep your hands and your mind on the road Glympse as we mentioned is similar and lets you share your location with otherswho just might rat you out when you speed GasBuddycom lets you find the cheapest gas near your location
 Nooly Micro Weather reports uberlocalized weather within 4 miles of where you are and just 15 minutes into the future preparing you for the fog bank around the next curve on a mountain road As we write this it is available as a phone app and the developer is working with Ford and Toyota for the app to be included in cars as they ship The integrated automotive Nooly will signal the car to turn on fog lights or the defroster a moment before the weather changes 
 Waze is a mobile app that lets drivers share updates on road conditions in near realtime With a community of nearly 50 million members as of May 2013 it is perhaps the most robust source of usergenerated road data in the world Google acquired Waze in the summer of 2013 for just under 1 billion 
 After Hurricane Sandy devastated the Northeast in late October 2012 northern New Jersey motorists were frustrated because service stations were randomly opened or closed FEMA asked Waze for help The startup turned to its community of New Jersey motorists to share which stations were operating significantly easing one of the many problems created by the storm
 Take My CarNot My Phone


 The final and most significant reason for carmakers to recognize the phones rightful place at the center of the contextual universe is that it is increasingly central to the lives of future customers
 According to the New York Times American teens prefer owning a smartphone to a car We found confirmation of this trend wherever we looked and believe it is one that people thinking about the next few years and decades should consider
 Back in 1978 92 percent of all 16yearolds in the United States had a drivers license or learners permit By 2008 it was only 77 percent Even more interesting kids who do have cars drive less The US Department of Transportation reports that people under 30 are logging about 10 percent fewer miles per year than the same age group did a decade earlier
 By contrast young people are spending more time on their phones A new generation is emerging that considers their phones to be their personal computers Simultaneously it is becoming cool to not own a car at all 
 Ford is not trying to reverse the trend with an expensive marketing campaign as carmakers would have done in earlier eras Instead it is coping with the democratization of technology and following the lead of future customers by investing in Zipcar an urban ridesharing service and TechShop where urban entrepreneurs can access advanced tech tools to germinate new citybased businesses 
 A Blind Spot


 As impressed as we were with the automotive industrys understanding of contextual technology and its importance to the future of cars we were disappointed to find that as of now none seems to be considering the impact of digital eyewear such as Google Glass
 In our view a computer that understands who is behind the wheel and sees exactly what the driver sees has great promise Devices that can respond to voice blinking tapping and gesturing seem safer and more intuitive and might reduce the hordes of people who break laws and ignore common sense rules of safety by using phones while driving
 Yet we didnt find a single automaker expressing interest or enthusiasm for the fastdeveloping phenomenon of digital eyewear
 Toyota came the closest when they said they were experimenting with dashboard displays that appear on the windshield so that drivers wouldnt have to look down 
 We think the new wearable devices are a better less distracting and more imminent solution They are likely to be less expensive than a windshield option They will also provide many useful mobile apps that can be used ubiquitously while the windshield dashboard will obviously just be used in the car Software will be easier to keep current A broken device will be easier to replace than a damaged windshield
 The issues of regulation and adoption bring us to what may be the most significant and controversial changes in car making since horsepower replaced horses
 We refer of course to the driverless car
 

 Chapter 5


 Driving Over the Freaky Line

 People are so bad at driving cars that computers dont have to be that good to be much better

 Marc Andreessen investor

 Picture this It is not very far into the future and you have just arrived in a big city You summon an Uber car via a mobile app and a nicelooking upscale sedan soon pulls up to the curb in front of you
 You hop in the back seat and tell absolutely no one behind the wheel where you are going You buckle up because the nonexistent driver insists you do so or the car will not proceed Then no one at all maneuvers city traffic and delivers you safely to your destination where you leave without paying as your transaction takes place automatically online
 Even Robert Scoble a legendary lover of new technologies says that this scenario freaks him out yet some time in the next 5 to 50 years this will be commonplace
 Once people get past their discomfort they will discover that driverless cars are safer than those driven by people They are also more energy efficient and dont wander over lanes like people do The pilots dont daydream or get competitive with other vehicles or demonstrate road rage because the last passenger didnt tip
 Instead of driving people will be able to do some work catch up on their social networks grab a few winks or watch a video Millions of human hours formerly dedicated to driving will be freed up for whatever activities can be accomplished while riding as safely along a highway as passengers do on a train
 The technology for this to happen may come sooner than people are ready to accept But dont worry Government regulators the economics of technology lawyers and other timesucking forces will probably slow progress down until you or perhaps your grandchildren get to ride in a driverless car
 Its Complicated


 At the 2013 CES thousands of attendees saw demos of Audi and Lexus driverless concept cars Some observed that they seemed nearly ready for production We learned its more complicated than that
 Prior to CES thousands of Northern California drivers had already been startled while driving along public roads to pass vehicles with odd spinning devices mounted on their roofs These cars usually moved at precisely the speed limit and contained passengers Normal enough except that no one was behind the wheel
 These were part of Googles growing fleet of experimental selfdriving cars They employ shortrange radar laser beams and motion and 3D sensors The technology allows the cars to discern whats around them in all directions and decide what if anything to do about it
 The rooftop spinners contain a new technology called lidar Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging Its a technical cousin to radar thats offered by at least two companies Aerometric and Velodyne Lidar uses optical sensors and laser beams that bounce off the surrounding terrain as the test car travels down the road It sees everything lane markers signs people and other cars
 Google Audi VW and Lexus are testing lidar devices and we assume other carmakers are as well To date lidar is the secret sauce of selfdriving but other technologies are also under development
 Price and technology are of course key issues but safety is the critical one These autopiloted cars are proving they are safe Google reported early in 2013 that its fleet had logged more than 500000 miles on public roads with only a single minor scrape
 To demonstrate and perhaps dramatize how safe their lidarbased system already is Google invited Steve Mahan of Morgan Hill California to be the first consumer to give the Google car a whirl
 The car chugged along at low speeds on streets cordoned off by local police In this controlled environment the car worked perfectly carrying Mahan to a local Taco Bell where it backed easily into a parallel parking space Then it brought him to the cleaners where he picked up his laundry and drove him back home
 Mahan sat behind the wheel but he did not drive which would have been unsafe indeed Hes legally blind For him such a car has no freaky factor He wants one as soon as he can get it He told a news reporter that such a car would change my life
 This we presume would also be true for many of the other 25 million blind adults in the United States not to mention people all over the world with other disabilities that prevent them from driving Mahan represents a group of people who have a compelling need for such a car They will be the early adopters for this technology When people with these kinds of disabilities are able to use driverless cars it may reduce the freakiness that Scoble and the rest of us feel about them
 However that does not mean lidar is ready for prime time The devices seem to work fine in fair weatherwhich might explain why most testing is being conducted in places like Nevada and Californiabut people need cars that can handle diverse weather conditions
 Lidar is protected by a frail glass barrier and can be damaged by pebbles and other debris Snow and fog confuse them and they have trouble detecting road ice
 In 2013 a lidar unit cost 70000 down about 5000 from the previous year With two competing companies producing similar devices we would have thought the prices would have come down more quickly More important lidar spinners are only a small part of the cost of a Google selfdriving kit We were told the experimental unit if released today would retail for about 500000 automobile not included We did not ask about volume discounts
 Sleeping Drivers and Baby Steps


 Another group of possible early adopters may be more commercially viable because they could earn back an investment of several hundred thousand dollars per vehicle in a relatively short period of timecommercial truck fleet owners
 Currently many big rig trucks have two drivers who are being paid around the clock Autopilots would allow trucking companies to cut staff Seeing autopiloted big rigs on the highway may be disconcerting at first but in time people would recognize that they are safe less expensive to operate and less polluting
 If big trucking companies are the earliest adopters perhaps they would be followed by smaller truck operators such as FedEx furniture movers and pizza delivery vans That would drive the price down further perhaps eventually setting the stage for kits as an option in luxury cars
 All of this would erode public discomfort with driverless vehicles After all if its safe enough to take an 18wheeler over thousands of nonstop miles it must be safe enough for the family Volvo to carry the kids to a soccer game
 Meanwhile the auto industry is proceeding cautiously getting the technology right and people ready by taking the sort of baby steps that Googles Narayanan talked about in Chapter 3
 One such baby step is selfparking a feature in many new cars An Audi YouTube clip posted early in 2013 to show how selfparking will soon work somehow reminded us of the old cowboy movies where the whitehatted hero whistles and his horse comes running
 In Audis clip it is not a cowpoke but a businesswoman and she uses a mobile app rather than a whistle She emerges from her vehicle whips out her smartphone and commands her Audi to go park itself in a garage Viewers watch the driverless vehicle crawl up a garage ramp find a snug spot and into it
 Later she uses the same app to summon it back As she waits she watches the car approach on her app The car knows where its owner is via a location sensor in the phone
 Annie Lien is an independent automated driving consultant who was formerly program manager at Volkswagen Group Electronics Research Lab in Menlo Park California where she was in charge of product and marketing for conceptual cars under the Audi Bentley Bugatti Lamborghini Porsche and Volkswagen brands She played a key role in the development of experimental cars such as the driverless Audi in the video
 Lien prefers to call them automatic or autopiloted rather than selfdriving because it will be a very long time before cars operate without a driver who can take over the controls except for limited lowspeed activities such as selfparking she says
 No matter what you call them they are cars that drive themselves and we do not feel that less disruptivesounding words reduce the freaky factor
 Lien predicts the first automatic cars to be offered to the public will come out sometime between 2025 and 2030 and they will be expensive Widespread adoption she guesses would not happen until after 2050nearly 40 years after the 2013 CES revealed pentup demand for them
 Lien walked us through a multitude of issues that dampen our hopes that the selfdriving objects we see in the future are closer than they appear To get from a consumer exhibition to general use on public roads will require a great many incremental steps in technology refinement user acceptance and cost as well as institutional adjustments such as legislation liability and mixeduse roadways
 Lien predicts that selfdriving cars will first be available in urban scenarios because the technology can understand terrain and traffic patterns more easily and cars move at lower speeds
 Industrywide some cars have already instituted features that are helpful in urban settings Automatic parking features use sensors to back into tight spots without curb scrape or bumper tapping and trafficjam assistance recognizes patterns and adjusts lanes or routes for the driver thus burning less fuel
 Other manufacturers either echo Liens views or brush our questions aside A Lexus representative told us automatic cars are just a concept nothing more We have no launch plan which made us wonder why the company invested so much to show them at CES
 According to Scott Monty head of social media at Ford Customers still prefer to drive themselves Monty may have a point Weve noticed that many drivers never use the cruise control function available in many cars so why would they opt for a driverless feature 
 The answer is that most people dont know what they want until they see it We think when such vehicles become available safer and more sustainable the idea of having more time to conduct other activities will be pretty compelling to many
 The auto industry is steering toward the automatic car Everywhere we visited in researching this chapter we saw and heard about little steps where cars can now make decisions that drivers traditionally made Lots of cars have sensors that start wipers when they sense water Some now automatically send and receive messages to other cars At Toyota they told us of cars talking with traffic lights to avoid bottlenecks and collisions at intersections
 Some experts are more optimistic about when driverless cars will arrive in a showroom near you Bob Lutz GMs retired vice chairman predicts that driverless cars would be ubiquitous in about 20 years
 We think it will be more like ten years before the vehicles are technically ready and affordable In the time it took us to write this chapter our friend John Markoff a New York Times technology reporter may have witnessed a technological breakthrough when he was a passenger in a driverless lidarless Audi A7 that zipped down an Israeli highway at 65 miles an hour
 Equipped with a system from a Netherlandsbased start up called Mobileye Vision Technologies the system could significantly reduce costs compared with lidarbased systems
 During the same period Teslas Musk who has long been linked by investments and friendship with Googles founders declared Googles current approach  is too expensive Its better to have an optical system  that can figure out whats going on just by looking at things
 So far however optical systems only work on flat and sunny highwaysnot on city streets How long it will take to make them safe in all situations remains an unanswered question Still we will bet on entrepreneurs and opportunity to accelerate the road to market
 Institutional Barriers


 What may slow down the driverless car as decisively as OnStars antitheft feature slows car thieves is government regulation and how liability will be assigned
 History shows that public officials are not often motivated by common sense and public safety For example as we mentioned some states are still debating seat belts and helmets after more than 50 years
 Could the process be expedited Progress makes odd bedfellows Insurance carriers would love to see liability shift from drivers to carmakers so would lawyers who would see larger contingency fee possibilities Federal agencies may also support speeding up the regulatory process The US Department of Transportation has already stated it favors autopiloting and the Environmental Protection Agency EPA might like the reduced pollution from autopiloted cars
 All this gives us some cause for hope Perhaps New Hampshire could change its motto from Live Free or Die to Drive HandsFree and Live
 So why is virtually every major carmaker investing decades and dollars into developing driverless vehicles when it will increase their own liability
 Volkswagens Lien suggests two reasons First we do it because we can Engineers see a possibility and they just have to go for it They cannot stop themselves It is their nature Second if our company doesnt develop automatic driving capability another company will No carmaker wants to be left behind Yet another reason is that it will be easier for carmakers to comply with environmental regulations because autopilots perform more efficiently
 Those who see these cars as 50 years away are assuming that the pace will continue at its present rate disregarding how technology development often accelerates beyond predictable rates We believe that government has an obligation to make rules that ensure public safety whether it be helmets seat belts or autopilots in cars The issue is that technology innovation moves so much faster than the regulators The regulatory gap is likely to cause injury and death
 What we find interesting is the evidence that the next generation may branch into two automotive subgroups those who go driverless and those who go without cars altogether That latter group is composed of a demographic group that is growing in number and significance
 We call them the New Urbanists
 

 Chapter 6


 The New Urbanists 

 We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard  because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept

 John F Kennedy 

 Greg Lindsay was born in 1977 in the central Illinois village of Bourbonnais an hours drive south of Chicago He was raised in a modest singlefamily home on the last residential street before cornfields replaced houses 
 He grew up unsatisfied in his surroundings At the time Bourbonnais had a population of about 10000 and early on Lindsay became curious to see more than what his village had to offer It helped when he turned 16 and got his wheels He got his first taste of urban life when he attended summer camp in Philadelphia
 Lindsay left home to earn a journalism degree at the University of Illinoisat UrbanaChampaign a community he found to be even more culturally rural than his hometown He was fortunate to land summer internships in San Francisco and then New York City where he flourished in city life
 Almost immediately after graduation Lindsay moved to New York City where he has remained for the past 15 years Once I got here I never looked back he says 
 He describes himself to us as an ardent urbanist a passionate champion of a city life enriched by contextual technologies Hes made a profession of it writing about cities and the future for such respected publications as FastCompany the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal Intel Audi and Blackberry are among the companies that have invited him in to talk about the emerging trend toward contextual cities 
 Lindsay his wife Sophie and their young son Teddy own a shoebox apartment in Brooklyn Heights We live in the oldest and arguably most beautiful neighborhood in Brooklyn steps away from Brooklyn Bridge Park along the East River with playgrounds athletic fields and breathtaking views he says Weve traded a considerable amount of private space for oneofakind public amenities
 The Lindsays dont own a car When they need one theres a Zipcar garage nearby The rest of the time they get around by subway bikes and on foot Each morning Lindsay walks to his cowork space dropping little Teddy off at daycare en route To visit Sophies folks near Boston they take the Amtrak Bullet Train 
 I like the buzz and connection of city life I want to live and work and raise my family in a city environment he says
 New Urbanists


 The Lindsay family is not alone They are among millions of young adults raised in the suburbs who left home for higher education and then moved to cities where they found jobs established roots and are raising families 
 These New Urbanists are educated and financially comfortable They are more connected to their mobile devices than to cars and backyard patios They represent a significant trend that is accelerating the transition into this new Age of Context
 They are changing the character and flavor of their cities and their concerns for raising children are helping them lead charges for safer streets and better education where contextual tools play a part
 These New Urbanists reverse a trend followed by each generation since the end of World War II For more than 60 years people migrated out of cities into suburbs Today instead of opting for freestanding singlefamily homes surrounded by lawns fences and chirping birds this emerging generation is massively opting for less pastoraland more stimulatingurban settings
 New Urbanism is changing American demographic trends Multiple reports including those from the US Census Bureau and the Brookings Institution see multiyear trends where cities are growing younger and more affluent while suburbs are shrinking aging and experiencing increases in poverty
 New Urbanists lead contextual lives in cities being planned designed and rebuilt with contextual technologies There are tens of millions of them and their numbers are growing
 Mobile devices along with sensors data location and social networks are essential to how New Urbanists will work raise families use transportation shop communicate learn stay healthy and even influence government and politics in the coming years 
 Few own cars or want to Like the Lindsays they walk use bikes scooters skateboards public transit and shared car services 
 Lindsay maintains that the urban boom would not be possible without the contextual forces I see a direct line between the downfall of the car and the rise of connected technology he says You no longer have to cruise to find somebody We now have social media to find people who interest us This is what tilted the balance to the city for my generation
 This of course will significantly change cities over the next generation or twoperhaps longer The New Urbanists will expect and get more from municipal governments Cloudbased technologies will make it inexpensive and easy for governments to disseminate information widely and to facilitate scalable conversations with their constituencies In fact they already do
 Of course we have a long way to go before we attain a truly open responsive government However when we look at a few forwardthinking municipal governments we see glimmers of hope
 New Urbanists are active proponents of safer streets reduced pollution transparent government and neighborhood activism They are using contextual technologies as power tools for change
 Their shoppingeven when localis becoming mobile devicecentric They are encouraging and adopting new services that allow local merchants to deliver goods to urban doors
 New Urbanism is not only taking hold in such cultural centers as New York and San Francisco but also in previously forsaken places like Pittsburgh Detroit and Youngstown Ohio which is reporting a significant growth in young adults spawned in part by a tech center that employs more than 300 people mostly recent college grads Even Cleveland which in 2010 was voted Americas most miserable city is enjoying a resurgence of energy from this desirable demographic 
 Allison Peltz 30 raised and educated in suburban Ohio moved into Cleveland when she took an interactive marketing job She rented an 800squarefoot studio in downtown Cleveland in 2011 
 Clevelandis booming she reports Theres a sense of community downtown My neighbors and I look to the streets and parks as our backyards and playgrounds We support local businesses 
 New Urbanists are driving cities into a Renaissance A great deal of energy and activity is going into the development of theater music crafts fairs farmers markets and nightlife 
 However there is a very significant catch to all this urban infrastructure Many of Americas cities are crumbling from old age and neglect Estimates to repair the countrys roads bridges and buildings run as high as 36 trillion and most of the infrastructure needing repair is in or around urban centers 
 Many new infrastructure projects are being completed on time and even under budget which is almost unprecedented in recent urban history At the core of this change are two contextual technologies open cloud and 3D modeling 
 CloudBased Government


 Open cloud and 3D modeling help New Urbanists see the future of their cities and simultaneously have a say in their development
 Lets start with access All sorts of municipal plans records and urban modeling are being moved from locked vaults into the open cloud where citizens can access far more than ever before and they can do it on mobile apps 
 Compare that with the traditional way of finding public information Formerly a citizen had to spend an afternoon entombed in the Hall of Records poring over blueprints thick manila folders and microfilm
 Now new developments are built in 3D models where anyone can see an urban plan as it will stand on the groundand below it Citizens can see how a new development will impact surrounding areas They can understand how lowering an elevated stretch of highway into a tunnel will provide new open spaces and let formerly isolated neighborhoods connect and interact Of course physical models will still be put on display but its much more convenient to view the renderings online whenever you want
 All this clarity and access make it easier for people to see what buildings are being proposed anticipate how those plans will change their lives and give feedback during the planning stage before ground is broken 
 Several municipal officials told us it is better to serve as a collaborator than as an authority If its government by collaboration all sides win says Jonathan Mark former GIS and CADD services manager for Vancouver British Columbia New technologies allow all stakeholders to participate in planning and with the new 3D modeling all parties can see what the future looks like 
 Mark broadened our concept of contextual technology Until we dug into it we regarded predictive technologies to be just about human behavior But 3D modeling lets people regard their communities as living breathing moving thingsecosystems where the health of any one part impacts all the other parts Its difficult to grasp that concept when studying a blueprint but it is readily evident in a 3D model
 The 3D models let all parties understand how a single small adjustment can impact traffic and shopping patterns or create possible disruptions to school or safety They make it easy to forecast what will happen if a city is hit by a catastrophic storm earthquake or flood 
 These predictive capabilities help first responders plan rescue operations Educators can see where young families are moving and forecast when and where new schools will be needed Retailers and healthcare professionals can see where new shops and offices are likely to flourish
 These firstever omnibus views of urban plans provide a path to better communications collaboration and trust among government officials contractors and constituents History shows that relationships between these disparate groups have a great deal of room for improvement
 We do not argue that 3D modeling is a panacea but we do say that it creates a better platform and a more positive starting point
 Modeling Cities


 As New Urbanists increase in number and influence and become civic forces to be reckoned with the cities they inhabit will continue to face daunting and messy issues worsened by years of neglect 
 In these tough times it can be chilling to realize the jawdropping costs of modernization Its a good newsbad news package good because spending boosts the economy by creating jobs and supporting local suppliers bad because such massive urban projects have welldocumented histories of corruption shoddy workmanship and financial mismanagement
 A recent example of financial mismanagement and possibly corruption was the fiasco known as the Big Dig Designed to hide a small but unsightly and congested stretch of highway in central Boston the Big Dig was projected to cost 28 billion and take ten years to build when it began in 1982 Twentyfive years and approximately 22 billion later it stands as a case study of what to avoid in public works projects Many people are thus justifiably jaded about redevelopment 
 Nearly every major city in North America has multiple ongoing modernization projects The hope is that 3D modeling will produce lessflawed results Cloudbased technologies can increase transparency and hopefully facilitate less corrupt processes 
 Lately in cities like Seattle San Francisco Memphis Vancouver Orlando Miami and Chattanooga urban projects have been coming in on time and within budget and have proven to fulfill the promises of program advocates The resulting developments look and function as expected and they are less disruptive to surrounding areas
 Autodesk is a world leader in 3D design software for entertainment manufacturing engineering construction and civil infrastructure Their software was used in the planning designing and modeling of most of the urban projects we looked at
 Doug Eberhard senior director of Architecture Engineering Construction AEC sales development at Autodesk explains that 3D modeling tools allow large developments to be built the way smaller carpentry projects used to be conducted There is an old contractors saying Build it once Build it right For too many years urban developers seemed to be saying build it once then repair it often because theres money in it says Eberhard That has really changed There is more collaboration in the planning phase and fewer mistakes in the results
 Urban designers architects and contractors use these models for clash detectionthe ability to see a problem that previously could not be detected until construction was under way such as a vent interfering with an elevator shaft or an underground pipeline intersecting a train tunnel 
 On a grander scale some cities including Chicago and New York have built 3D models of their entire urban structure These models help engineers see the impact of a new highway exit and how it may cause traffic problems near a school several miles away
 Seattle recently had two renewal projects simultaneously under development one a public roadway and the other private residential office and retail development 
 Parsons Brinckerhoff the engineering firm on both projects built a detailed 3D model showing about five square miles of the citys center It simulated how the two projects would impact each other and the surrounding areas incorporating 40 different aspects of the city including traffic flow sewer lines and gas utilities
 According to Autodesks Eberhard whose software was used in both projects Everyone could predict what would happen before it happened We compiled analytics that could forecast the impact of everything It took ten years to plan the Seattle projects and four years to build them So far all parties are ecstatic with the results
 You might think that 3D modeling is limited to just three dimensions but time is another dimension 3D modeling software can help make visible Models can show how an urban area will age over 5 10 or 50 years For example New York City has been using 3D models to predict the impact on subway tunnels of the rising water bodies surrounding Manhattan All of New York Citys data is stored in a single cloudbased space 
 Equally important is the ability to filter out what you dont need to see at a particular time As Eberhard notes A first responder needs to see floor plans understand whats underground to see where fire hoses hook up and where hazardous materials are stored When she or he enters a burning building knowing where the nearest Starbucks is located is not helpful data
 Perhaps augmented reality can be used in a future Google Glass PairaSight app or other digital eyewear device to see whats ahead in a smokefilled hallway To us this is an example of using anticipatory technology as if your life depended upon it What starts as a cloudbased model today may save the life of a firefighter or blast victim tomorrow
 A Smarter Approach


 Herman Hollerith was born in Buffalo in the 1860 He studied to be a mining engineer and wound up teaching at MIT It is said he tinkered a lot and in 1890 he invented the first electric tabulating machine 
 Finding the machine could count heads with unprecedented speed the US Census Bureau became Holleriths first customer He thought the new machine might provide him with a business opportunity so he founded the Tabulating Machine Company 
 Over the next few years TMC merged with several other companies one the maker of coffee grinders When Thomas J Watson became president of the company in 1915 he focused on making machines for businesses worldwide Watson was fond of the literal and straightforward He renamed the merged entity International Business Machines or IBM for short
 IBM the most enduring of all technology companies has a long history of reinventing itself as times change It has evolved from making tabulating machines to making mainframes to making PCs and now to providing software and services for large organizations IBM does quite well in its current business but so do several other companies and to outsiders each seems to closely resemble the other
 Perhaps it was with a desire to differentiate itself from those others that in 2006 the company set up a series of meetings with employees partners and customers called innovation jams To see its own future IBM stepped back to look at global issues such as population pollution economics and health
 The company started examining how its current team of more than 425000 employees in about 200 countries could use their existing skills to make a better world and in so doing strengthen the companys software and services position 
 Among IBMs assets is that it understands data and uses it to devise anticipatory systems thatpredictunforeseen events IBM has taken that and is applying it to its Smarter Planet initiative addressing the complex global issues of health banking and cities 
 The Smarter Cities initiative is now a global business for IBM with projects all over the world When they examine urban centers they watch for emerging patterns from which they can glean insights for municipal clients Pattern recognition enables them to identify problems sooner and resolve them faster than their competition 
 IBM has already accumulated some impressive accomplishments in the few short years the practice has been in existence Although the company is globally focused we asked them specifically about USbased projects Of the ones they submitted here are our favorites
 Memphis Police say that IBMs predictive analytics have helped them identify criminal hot spots which allows them to anticipate whereand whenserious crimes are likely to occur Based on the data they reallocated patrol cars and other resources reducing major and violent crime by as much as 30 percent Pattern recognition also helps police understand trends that previously went unnoticed For example they now know that car thefts increase on rainy nights
 San Francisco IBMs use of data and embedded sensors has reduced pollution emanating from the citys thousand miles of sewer lines Public utilities report that IBMs preventive intelligence has helped reduce improve their preventive to corrective maintenance repair costs ratio by 11 percent 
 ChattanoogaHamilton County The county uses IBMs predictive analytics to understand how adverse patterns develop This allowed them to identify atrisk children earlier so educators could adjust personal attention and curriculum resulting in an 8 percent increase in the graduation rate One facility the Howard School of Academics and Technology reported the graduation rate tripling over the programs first six years
 MiamiDadeCounty IBM has helped the 35 Dade County municipalities share data thus making it easier to collaborate in a wide array of areas including water transportation and law enforcement They are also sharing contextual technologies to make government more transparent A new water project alone is expected to save the county 1 million per year
 Contextual City Startups


 IBM has also served as a global recruiter mentor and partner for startups focused on solving city problems with contextual technology A few that are associated with IBM to various degrees include
 Bitcarrier a Barcelonabased startup has created a contextual traffic platform composed of sensors Wifi and just a little intelligence says chief operating officer Ricardo Fernandez 
 The platform gathers data from as many as 20 million points across a citys grid shown on municipal traffic heat maps Managers use the information to reroute traffic simultaneously reducing congestion and noise and air pollution 
 The sensors replace cameras increasing privacy and reducing costs by up to 90 percent Fernandez estimates Traffic administrators can respond quickly to accidents and other surprises
 Bitcarrier also improves public transportation systems City buses adjust so they dont drive around halfempty and extra buses can be dispatched quickly 
 Most cities cannot adjust traffic signals to accommodate events such as concerts or ballgames because the software runs on data that is up to three years old and cant adjust to current information
 When we talked in March 2013 Bitcarrier was in use in Panama City Helsinki Barcelona Madrid and Zaragosa Spain and the company was in late discussions with several other cities 
 Libelium also a Spanish startup was a finalist in IBM SmartCamp a global series of IBMsponsored startup competitions 
 Libelium CEO Alicia Asin explains that the company is focused on the Internet of Things a concept we discussed in Chapter 1 to describe when inanimate objects talk with people and with each other The company whose name is Latin for dragonfly deploys insectlike swarms of tiny sensors called motes which report on changes in a wide range of activities that impact safety efficiency vegetation growth and sustainability 
 It is an open sensor platform that was being used by more than 2000 developers as of April 2013 For example Libelium technology helps vineyards decide which varietals of grapes to grow based on environmental conditions
 Libeliums main business is creating smart parking systems mostly in urban areas all over the world Magnetic sensors are installed under pavement to determine whether a car is parked in a space or not The system sees the GPS of a car looking for parking and can direct it to the nearest open spot via a mobile app
 According to Asin the smart parking system is politically popular because it pays for itself by ensuring that cars pay to park or get fined The efficiency reduces air and noise pollution 
 Libeliums most dramatic sensor effort was in Fukushima Japan following the 2011 nuclear disaster 
 At the governments request Libelium designed a sensor panel that was installed in and around areas suspected of radiation contamination Each panel served as an autonomous wireless Geiger counter which then broadcast realtime information into a cloudbased open network 
 Citizens posted radiation readings from their locations to the site and those measurements appeared on a map alongside values from inside contaminated zones
 After a couple of weeks we had a radiation map of Japan It represented a common thought for people to share and be helpful to all Asin says Its where I came to understand the power of citizens in a Smarter Cities program
 Moving forward the system will help the country respond faster and more effectively if another tsunami strikes
 Nooly the Israelbased hyperlocal sensorbased weather detection service we told you about in Chapter 4 is another earlyphase company working with IBM in various cities
 Unlike conventional weather forecasts Nooly covers small distances and sees weather changes such as hurricanes snowstorms and flooding one or two hours before they hit
 According to CEO Yaron Reich Nooly can warn cities when weather is about to cause traffic snarls and where accidents are likely to happen Cities can use the short lead time to make fast routing adjustments 
 Reich sees places where Nooly sensors could even save lives The sensors could detect a flash flood and underground crews could be warned to evacuate to avoid drowning Likewise Nooly can serve as another tool for first responders such as firefighters who need to understand wind rain and other weatherrelated factors
 Less dramatically Nooly can help cities save money and provide more efficient services Although municipal power consumption is relatively predictable along seasonal patterns cities cannot account for heat waves or frost where quick grid adjustments can save energy and costs 
 Nooly can also predict evaporation rates in public parks during excessively hot days and can adjust watering systems accordingly
 Waze the communitybased traffic and navigation app we talked about in Chapter 4 can help cities get smarter about changing traffic light patterns to reduce traffic 
 Users help each other route around trouble spots reducing travel times and headaches It also helps urban traffic run more efficiently by providing realtime data that can help traffic managers reroute traffic around trouble spots and show the best place to find parking restrooms and motorist amenities 
 FutureMakers


 There has been much talk in recent years about restoring manufacturing jobs that have moved from the United States to places where labor is cheaper and worker protection less stringent 
 We doubt this will happen in significant numbers or in sustainable ways First such a reversal would appreciably raise the cost of consumer goods and second most Americans dont want most of the jobs that have been outsourced
 However lots of new light manufacturing jobs are being created every day and it looks like their numbers will continue to increase in Americas cities for a long time We were told that there are currently at least a million new light manufacturing jobs in the United States already most of them in cities
 These jobs are being spawned by the rising tide of the maker movement a grassroots trend that has been taking shape for more than a decade but seems about to hit an exponential growth phase It is composed of people who quite simply make stuff 
 Makers are a diverse group of doityourselfers hobbyists entrepreneurs bright kids and retirees They produce and often market tangible consumer goods that range from knitted products to model planes
 The movement has its own online magazine and three annual Maker Faires that are attended by an estimated 165000 people not to mention the ubiquitous crafts fairs that take place all the time 
 The grand cathedral for the maker movement is TechShop a cultural social and inspirational center for those who want to turn an idea into a business with little money and often a great sense of urgency
 As Mark Hatch TechShop CEO guided us through the 17000squarefoot San Francisco facility which he said was nearly identical to the other five located in other US urban centers it seemed to us to be a combination community and learning center hackerspace and modern machine shop Everyone we saw seemed ecstatic and busy
  Hatch reported that countless companies have been formed by people who first met at TechShop Some of their bestknown alumni include Square the fastgrowing mobile payment company DODOcase makers of a bamboo iPad case and other products that took in 37 million in 2012 and Clustered Systems a nextgeneration computer cooling system Driptech an inexpensive scalable irrigation system thats used in India and China was started at TechShop by a Stanford University student
 TechShop Hatch told us provides people with access to advanced tools software and space They invite makers to come and build dreams for 125 a month or less Individuals or small teams can frolic in a creative playground that includes over 1 million worth of equipment and software 
 Each TechShop facility provides expensive highend laser cutters plastics and electronics labs a machine shop a woodworking shop a metal working shop a textiles department welding stations and a waterjet cutter that can slice through five inches of any material on Earth according to Hatch 
 The entire suite of Autodesk Design softwarethe same tools used by urban plannersis available to TechShop members The 3D modeling software that can inexpensively create products on available 3D printers seems to be the most popular TechShop members also receive free instruction on how to use the software 
 Like other cathedrals TechShop builds culture this one is entrepreneurial TechShop sponsors numerous events to bring people together with investors businesses experts and each other It holds a continuous stream of events designed to let members share ideas form partnerships or just provide encouragement 
 Hatch describes TechShop as a transformative experience where hobbyists evolve into entrepreneurs who then emerge into manufacturers The facility helps in every aspect of starting an enterprise including fundraising It even has a direct hotline to the US Patent office This is a place to start something inexpensively then move on Hatch said
 We met one such entrepreneur Brian Burling who founded eMotimo in 2010 He told us that his company makes robotic camera heads that provide the cheapest panning system on the planet
  TechShop changed the game for us he said The cost of starting a business using such hightech equipment has been reduced by orders of magnitude TechShop enables people to do rapid prototyping and provides a community environment that supports entrepreneurs who want to start a business or use a complicated machine
 Hatch said TechShop users have an extremely flat demographic There is an even distribution of people in their 20s 30s 40s and 50s The age of makers ranges from 8 to 80 The only significant change over our fiveyear history is that 40 percent of participants are now women When we started it was only 5 percent
 TechShop is a startup that exists to spawn other startups It certainly is an accelerator for entrepreneurs creating tangible goods and its thumbprint on cities for the New Urbanists is unmistakable As Scoble wrote in a blog post accompanying the video tour TechShop is the most important startup today
 We believe that TechShop is building an ecosystem that will be at the cultural heart of what the New Urbanists are doing to improve aging cities
 The fact that our New Urbanists are quick to embrace wearable technology is not just going to put people in closer touch with other people and institutions it is also going to put them far closer to the devices themselves
 In researching this chapter we were surprised by how profoundly many cities have changed for the better Of course they have miles to go before they stem the blight and deterioration that plagues sections of most of the worlds cities
 A bigger surprise was the healing we found in the highstakes industry where the institutions in control cause even greater damage to peoples wellbeing than local government healthcare
 

 Chapter 7


 The Contextual Self

 Quit worrying about your health Itll go away

 Robert Orben Gerald Fords speechwriter

 In Michael Crichtons 1972 novel Terminal Man the central character commits violent acts during blackouts To cure him a medical team inserts electrodes into his brain wiring them to an atomicpowered computer attached to his shoulder Of course the experiment runs amok The patient escapes and goes on a killing rampage
 Crichtons formula runs through several of his books including Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain Wellintentioned scientists invent something to make a better world It runs out of control people die The theme goes all the way back to Mary Shelleys Frankenstein
 Sometimes reality turns out to be less threatening than people fear Crichtons fictional vision of electrodes wires and nuclearpowered strapon devices has evolved into a reality of tiny sensors communicating by Wifi to mobile devices and even running on electricity produced by the body
 These technologies dont incite people to become homicidal maniacs Instead they help people become healthier and fitter Even though this new era of contextual health has just begun millions of people already enjoy its benefits
 Although all five forces play a role in contextual health sensors enjoy a starring role They are doing everything from helping people lose weight to arming doctors in the fight against cancer
 This is all new We could find no data on the size of the health sensor market in 2008 But by 2017 mobile health sensors connected to mobile health apps will be a 56 billion market Its value in terms of lives improved and saved will be immeasurable
 Sensors will reduce emergency room visits and invasive diagnostic tests Some lifethreatening diseases may be stopped before they do lasting damage Sensors will provide people with greater knowledge of their own bodies than until recently we were even able to imagine And that data will be shared with forwardthinking medical providers those willing to become unstuck from the way things have been done in the past 
 Sensors on Pills


 Redwood City Californiabased Proteus Digital Health is one of several earlyphase pioneers in sensorbased health technology They make a silicon chip the size of a grain of sand that is embedded into a safely digested pill that is swallowed 
 When the chip mixes with stomach acids the processor is powered by the bodys electricity and transmits data to a patch worn on the skin That patch in turn transmits data via Bluetooth to a mobile app which then transmits the data to a central database where a health technician can verify if a patient has taken her medications
 This is a bigger deal than it may seem In 2012 it was estimated that people not taking their prescribed medications cost 258 billion in emergency room visits hospitalizations and doctor visits An average of 130000 Americans die each year because they dont follow their prescription regimens closely enough
 Currently most doctors simply ask patients if they are taking their meds as directed The problem is that patients sometimes get confused they also lie about what medications they are taking One doctor told us that patients dont just forget to take their pillsthey throw them out to cover up their forgetfulness As a result pharmacists cant detect lapses based on prescription renewal rates 
 The Proteus solution gives doctors realtime irrefutable data on when pills are takenor skipped In April 2012 the FDA approved placebo testing Barring surprises sensorpills will come to market in 2015 or 2016 
 Sensorpills also measure heart rate and physical activity encouraging adherence as well as reporting key data to healthcare providers 
 Proteus CEO Andrew Thompson says the system has far greater potential than the monitoring of prescriptions It is being testedfor tracking tuberculosis mental health heart failure hypertension and diabetes
 Currently Proteus is the only company to receive FDA approval for sensorpills Other pioneering contextual health companies are working on tiny ingestible devices that could eliminate the sort of tests we hate such as colonoscopies and prostate examinations
 That is heartening news In our years of following leadingedge technology health has consistently lagged behind most other sectors Clearly something has changed While the institutional healthcare industry continues to move like a Luddite with a limp a bottomup movement is growing exponentially and contextual entrepreneurs rather than Washingtonbased policy makers are driving it Progress however remains uneven
 Wearable for Health


 Our earlier chapter on Google Glass and digital eyewear makes clear how important we believe such devices will be But only a few thousand eyewear devices are being used today and few of them are being used for healthrelated applications
 However millions of other wearable devices are helping people get fitter In fact health is the largest category of all wearable applications today Fitbit and Nike Fuelband are among the most popular 
 Fitbit calls its 99 clipon device the One but almost everyone else just calls it Fitbit It measures movement distance calories and sleep cycles 
 It is also a motivational tool helping you set goals by sending you cheery little congratulatory messages when you reach milestones Men complain the devices are easy to lose Women prefer them because they are easy to clip onto a bra strap where we are told it is virtually invisible through clothing
 Most important these devices have an addictive element to them Scobles wife Maryam lost 30 pounds using Fitbit She has struggled with weight loss for many years and had previously tried everythingincluding stomach staplingwithout success With Fitbit she has become addicted to a healthier lifestyle she reports
 Nike Fuelband costs about 150 and is worn on the wrist It is a flagship for the companys growing family of sensorenabled products all branded by the  Other  offerings include running shoes that tell you when to replace them and basketball shoes that record how high you jumped or dunked or tried to 
 All  products talk with Fuelband which serves as a platform for a personal private health network 
 We think Fuelband is a particularly attractive device with an elegant Appleesque design It contains an accelerometer and tracks exercise calories walking and so on Some people question how accurate it is at measuring distance traveled because it measures arm not leg motion
 The only criticism we heard about Fuelband was that there is no warning before the battery dies an easily fixed shortcoming Also you cant yet swim with a Fuelbandbut as Scoble demonstrated with Glass you can wear one in the shower
 Users praised the Nike site analytics as simple and easy to understand This is important Many of the new devices are heavy on analytics but for everyday users who just want to track essential exercise data less may be best Nike says its  family of sensorenabled gear backed by a strong marketing campaign had 6 million users in February 2012 
 The Quantified Self


 The very high end of these healthrelated wearable devices is the 199 Basis Designed for wellness and fitness Basis even tells time but with five sensors inside it does a lot more It measures pulse perspiration rate activity and body temperature as well as sleep quality Basically it provides enough data to satisfy an astrophysicist 
 The Basis site lets users drill deep down into personal data mines of stats charts and graphs It is a particular favorite of a growing movement called the Quantified Self which is composed of people who believe that the more personal data they have the better they can understand their own bodies and thus become and stay healthier They track and graph their behavior exercise location biology genes and anything else that interests them in the belief that the more they know the more they can adjust and improve their fitness and habits
 Many Quantified Selfers are serious athletes such as Olympic trainers triathletes professional performers and competition runners Some believe they can ultimately reach a point where they just wont need a doctor 
 Loic Le Meur producer of LeWeb Europes largest tech conference is an ardent fitness enthusiast and Quantified Self proponent In August 2010 he suggested in a blog post that as people and mobile devices work together to provide highly personalized data the human body itself becomes an Application Programming Interface API meaning that developers can now offer personalized mobile apps for each individual by letting their computer codes talk with each other
 From that perspective perhaps we are all becoming like The Terminal Man but todays picture looks far more positive than the one Crichton painted
 As Le Meur demonstrated in his blog Quantified Self data can build a personal anticipatory system You can see patterns in your exercise and diet You can detect correlations between those two factorsplus sleepand understand why you got sick or experienced an offpace run
 When Le Meur studied his personal patterns he saw that he grew stouter at about the same time every year and leaner at about the same time every year By seeing these repetitions more clearly Le Meur was able to understand how to break the patterns and perform better 
 We dont know if the day will come when people dont need doctors but we do know this The day has already come when available devices will help you stay healthier and fitter thus lightening the burden on the American healthcare system
 Social Fitness Networks


 Wearable devices sensors and data are weapons in a holistic war that must be fought on multiple fronts including in the workplace and at home and involving children the aging population and the chronically ill 
 All contextual forces are of course involved as well So is Andreessens free ice cream in the guise of competition gamification rewards and plain oldfashioned bribes
 Endomondo Sports Tracker uses your phone as a wearable device It employs social networking and competition to help users get fitter You strap your phone onto your upper arm during workouts races cycling and other strenuous sports It automatically uploads your personal data to its online community site which analyzes your results and progress You can add music route maps and heart rate monitors
 Endomondo also allows you to create a social network of your friends or you can join others who share your activity interests Participants compete or encourage each other as they see fit
 Founded in 2007 Endomondo reports it has a total of 12 million users and touts itself as the first social fitness network Users we talked with on Facebook and Twitter expressed love and loyalty to it sometimes calling it a lifechanger
  Endomondo is for play but employee fitness and health is a serious business issue and there are apps to address that as well
 Keas is an earlyphase company based in San Francisco that addresses the business side of personal health Founder Adam Bosworth describes it as a fitness social network that helps employers motivate workers to get healthier
 Prior to starting Keas Bosworth a respected industry veteran started and ran Google Health an illfated attempt to aggregate store and make available all medical records via a secure cloud storage system 
 While he was at Google Bosworth had to deal with some family healthcare issues I learned that just giving people access to their health information wasnt enough to change behavior he says 
 To help people develop better health habits he founded Keas in 2008 It provides a motivational fitness system for employees of large organizations such as Microsoft Although Keas sells its service to HR departments the system uses wordofmouth and grassroots techniques to spur adoption rather than the traditional topdown corporate memo approach
 Keas recruits a few employee evangelists who tell a few friends who then reach out to other peers until it eventually catches on across the entire enterprise
 Bosworth says the Keas system is composed of four elements inspiration motivation information andmost importantteam competition
 Employees form groups of six or fewer members They challenge other teams and then compete for points Employers award the winning players modest prizes perhaps cash a day off or a free dinner
 Players earn points by reaching healthrelated milestones weight loss a certain number of exercise sessions or distances run So being the fittest is not necessarily the most important asset Its at least equally valuable to meet your personal improvement milestones Not only do employees get motivated through competition they also understand that teammates count on each other to reap award benefits
 After five years of trial and error Bosworth says he has learned three key lessons
 Be positive and simple Tell an employee how much weight he has lost not how many pounds overweight he is Keep the data simple so that anyone can understand it
 Six is optimal Bosworth doesnt know why but trial and error has made him conclude that six the perfect team size 
 Social pressure matters Keass data is shared in an internal social community that is culturally strong on competition The pressure on each individual has less to do with meeting personal goals than contributing to a team effort
 One more aspect sets the system apart You cant cheat Patients may lie about drugs to their doctors but you cannot lie to your coworkers about the weight youve lost They can see for themselves Bosworth contends 
  Keas has effectively created what is known as a serious gameone designed to achieve a real purpose rather than to entertain Other existing serious games many of them in healthrelated areas are based on contextual technologies
 Bribes Lies and Diabetes


 Approximately 25 million people in the United States have diabetes and more than three times that number have what doctors call prediabetic conditions The costs in healthcare and loss of life each year are incalculable because both diseases contribute to so many other serious afflictions such as heart disease blindness amputations and organ failures The disease is particularly cruel to children
 Although institutional approaches have not changed much in many years a good deal is happening on the front lines of pediatric care where doctors parents and patients use contextual technologies to help kids fight these diseases more effectively
 Dr Jennifer Dyer a child endocrinologist in Columbus Ohio reveals the key to her successful practice bribes She doesnt take them she gives them to her teenage diabetic patients She uses incentives to motivate adolescents and gives them a mobile app she developed to aggregate data and help her optimize treatment plans
 She had been working on her system for five years when we spoke with her in April 2013 After much tweaking she had started to achieve consistently high success levels She believes what she does in her practice is replicable through a rewardbased mobile app similar to the model Keas uses She has incorporated a serious game as a system component called EndoGoal
 A teen participating in EndoGoal earns points every time she confirms on the app that she took her meds ate right or exercised The app features a cute virtual pet dog named Cooper that receives a treat whenever the patient takes appropriate action and whines when she doesnt
 Reaching milestones leads to reallife rewards in the form of iTunes songs prepaid Visa cards or retail gift certificates Local stores can contribute incentive rewards
 EndoGoal is really just a social business model Dyer says It works just like a Girl Scout Cookies drive Instead of getting a prize for selling cookies EndoGoal rewards patients for checking blood 
 Dyer personalizes the rewards in her practice when she can If I find out a patient likes bowling I take the time to learn about bowling and try to arrange for a related reward she says In return she gets data that helps her customize each kids program
 Like patients who lie about taking pills Dyers patients can be deceptivekids these days know how to manipulate technology For example some of her teenage patients know how to hack a glucose meter to make it look like their blood sugar levels are consistent and healthy when they are not
 So Dyer keeps an eye out for corroborating evidence If the meter says a patient had perfect and consistent glucose measurement scores every day for a month but the scales say he lost five pounds in that same period the evidence would imply an eating disorder that had been covered up by hacking the meter
 EndoGoal Dyer says makes it easy for a doctor to catch such deception and thus provide a chance to help the patient The app enables doctors to anticipate the patients direction and adjust treatment accordingly
 A Parents Best Helper


 Not all physicians are as techaware as Dyer who seems to understand how contextual technologies can help patients forge ahead even if the health industry stands still 
 Some parents also understand how to take the leadwhile doctors remain set in their old ways Instead of the formerly allknowing doctor Vivienne Mings best advisor for her son is datadriven technology
 Ming is not your typical parent when it comes to understanding technologys new capacities A neuroscientist with a PhD from Carnegie Mellon University and a visiting scholar at the University of California Berkeley Ming is chief scientist at Gild a San Francisco big data company that helps recruit tech sector talent Mings past work involved modeling the human brain She was among the first Glass wearers
 Both Ming and her partner are big data experts When their son Felix showed symptoms of childonset diabetes they did what they knew best They started collecting every bit of data they could on Felixs eating exercise and behavior
 The two also researched the most advanced technology for managing the disease They opted for a wireless OmniPod Insulin Pump that would work with a wireless Dexcom G4 Platinum continuous glucose monitoring system The system says Ming is ten times more precise than a standard measuring and dosing systemit automatically adjusts to changes in blood sugar levels
 They also purchased a Basis watch which they strapped around Felixs ankle His wrists were too small That provided them with even more data
 When the time came they gathered up their small data mountain and went to the endocrinologists office At the appropriate time we showed the doctor and nurse all the data we had gathered the data that told Felixs story she recalls They refused to take it from us Instead they gave us a paper form containing blanks for hand entering just three numbers every day 
 They wanted us to record those numbers for one random week over the threemonth period between visits and then enter those numbers into the printed form When we did they leaned over the sheet squinting at the numbers for a while then handed it back to us Ming continues She insisted that these were capable practitioners This is what they do They just dont know how to handle extra data she says
 Meanwhile the couple developed their own app for recording far more comprehensive data It has proved helpful For example they discovered that Felixs blood sugar spiked each school day morning but not on weekends Basis revealed a simultaneous reading via Galvanic skin response perspiration indicating anxiety Kindergarten was making little Felix nervous
 Anxiety causes adrenaline to spike which in turn elevates glucose A simple insulin adjustment solved the problemone that the doctor just looking at numerical averages would never have caught 
 Ming simply created a small anticipatory system that toggled insulin doses up on school days but not on weekends
 How big of a deal is this for Felix Its lifechanging according to Ming Elevated or lowered blood sugar levels cause children to misbehave in school If it is high a childs behavior can be wrongly diagnosed as Attention Deficit Disorder ADD if it is low teachers may mistakenly assume the child is suffering from depression
  Our little predictive app allows our son to have a normal life He can play with other kids do chores and take a few piano lessons He can have really normal kid experiences Ming says This would not have been possible without our app 
 Ming shared her experience in a talk at a Woman 20 conference in early 2013 After her talk an attendee approached her saying that she was starting a company to create similar predictive systems to manage a bloodclotting disorder She asked Ming to join the board
 The point is that technology is being underutilized in healthcare So many peoples lives are being wasted because they have uncontrolled diseases that could be controlled with available contextual technologies she says 
 Breathing in Place


 Like diabetes asthma affects about 25 million Americans More than 9 of children in the United States suffer from the disease It also seems to cause the greatest amount of suffering among children Asthma is a chronic disease that inflames and narrows the airways causing wheezing shortness of breath and coughing It has no cure 
 Asthma takes the lives of about nine people in the United States every day and accounts for onefourth of all emergency room visits The cost of treating each asthma patient is about 2000 annuallyfor a total of about 50 billion
 Causes of these painful and occasionally terminal wheezing attacks are most often blamed on airborne factors such as pollen and pollution For decades treatment has involved inhalers and allergy shotslots of them Now Asthmapolis an earlyphase company in Wisconsin has started taking a contextual approach to fighting asthma 
 Instead of just looking at what is in the air it is looking at whats on the ground It is using locationbased data to alter asthma sufferers patterns warning them to avoid certain areas and thus preventing attacks and reducing both medication needs and emergency room visits
 Of course sensors data and mobile technologies are involved The way it works is that a little caplike device containing a GPS sensor snaps on to the top of the inhaling devices that asthmatics carry
 When an attack comes and the patient uses the inhaler the device records the time and place and then transmits the data to a website where physicians and public health officials share access Data is collected from all users in an area and aggregated to reveal usage patterns and to identify geographic asthma hotspots It provides a very simple solution Avoid the place and you avoid an asthma attack
 An example of how simple the solution can be is reflected in the case of a group of asthmatic children at a particular New York City school who participated in an Asthmapolis beta test 
 The data revealed that kids seemed to use inhalants at the same place en route to and from school each day It turned out they were passing a refinery where air pollution was high By letting their parents know what block to avoid when going to and coming home from school the kids no longer needed to take two doses of medicine every school day
 Asthmapolis provides an unprecedented and inexpensive hope of bringing relief to patients who have had no new treatment options for generations
 Public health officials in Louisville Kentucky a city with higherthanaverage air pollution partnered with IBMs Smarter Cities and Asthmapolis to create a test project The city distributed 500 Asthmapolis sensors to patients Then it collected data to pinpoint previously undetected asthma hotspots
 Louisville could then inform local people who had respiratory issues of places to avoid thus reducing suffering and public health costs
 How does this impact the lives of the 25 million people afflicted with the disease We talked with just one Whitney Zatzkin a member of the TedMed Conference production team has had asthma since she was a child She is an early Asthmapolis beta user It helped me be a better patient she says The geographic information lets her use medications more wisely and perhaps see doctors less frequently 
 Place Matters


 Asthmapolis is part of a nascent but growing approach to health solutions geomedicine which looks for a correlation between geography and health 
 The approach is spearheaded by Bill Davenhall global manager for health and human services solutions at Esri a leader in geographic information systems He grew curious about the relationship between health and location after he suffered a surprise heart attack 
 It turned out that Davenhall had unwittingly resided all his life in places where environmental factors were known to increase heart attacks Despite the apparent connection no doctor ever asked him a single question about where he had lived 
 Although tons of data link location with such afflictions as heart disease cancer respiratory disorders diabetes and other lesser ailments the medical establishment has historically ignored location as a medical factor 
 Geomedicine is a form of contextual medicine From locationbased technologies doctors can predict what diseases you are likely to face down the line For example if you lived in the mountains where ozone layers are thin you are at greater risk for getting skin cancer Near polluted rivers Watch out for intestinal disorders Coal mines You face a higher than average likelihood of developing emphysema Geomedical practitioners can personalize their medical advice making adjustments based on where you have lived 
 Wearables for Seniors


 Wearable Technologies magazine our favorite resource for finding such technologies has reported on numerous wearable health related products targeted to the growing number of senior citizens who are using wearable devices to maintain their independence
 A common feature of all these devices is extreme ease of use Some seniors have never become comfortable with personal technology and others suffer from cognitive diseases such as Alzheimers 
 Among the devices that impressed us was the Vega Everon bracelet that uses GPS sensors to set up a safe zone so that people with cognitive disorders can walk freely on their own It also alerts the service if a patient wanders out of the zone 
 Similarly Tunstall Vi an athome patienttracking device has a base station that lets patients press one button if there is an emergency situation and another if they have a question The wearable component is a pendant embedded with a sensor that sends off an alert if a patient falls 
 BodyTel is a system that combines devices for glucose blood pressure and weight monitoring and can communicate with a smartphone 
 GrandCare Systems offers a telehealth system for patients in independent facilities It uses sensors to report the patients motion activities and vital signs to the service The site serves as a portal for family and healthcare providers to track patient data
 For Whatever Ails You


 We were surprised and pleased to discover that at this early stage the contextual health landscape is rapidly filling with a variety of devices able to provide people of all ages with solutions To get some sense of what we found consider these
 Athome urinalysis We found a free iTunes app called uChek that lets you pee on a strip in the comfort of your home bathroom then snap a photo and upload it to a mobile app for analysis Purchase of a kit is required to process test results Sessions in health facilities involving restrooms and plastic bottles can be a thing of the past
 Electronic mesh Researchers at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign are working on a tattoolike electronic mesh that is composed of sensors electrodes and Wifi The mesh is stamped onto the patients skin following surgery where it measures and transmits vital statistics such as skin hydration and body temperature It automatically dissolves in about two weeks
 Unattached prosthesis A University of Pittsburgh experiment is studying how brainwaves can operate nonconnected prosthetic devices A quadriplegic woman reportedly used an unattached artificial hand to feed herself chocolate 
 Smart toothbrushes Some apps improve pragmatic hygienic necessities Beam is shipping a sensorenabled toothbrush that focuses on getting kids to brush more Philips is in the latter stages of developing a sensorenabledtoothbrush that will sense tooth decay and text messages to the user as well as the family dentist
 Hospital hygiene At least two sensor systems are available to help improve the current deplorable 40 percent handhygiene compliance rate in US hospitals IntelligentM uses sensors to warn health care providers if they fail to perform appropriate hand hygiene before touching a patient medical equipment or supplies fostering realtime correction AgilTrack from General Electric attaches to washbasins in hospitals and reports employees who dont wash their hands This is a very critical lapse in patient safety in US hospitals today 
 Heart attack prediction A Swiss medical team has developed a tiny sensorcrammed implant Currently in the experimental stage the tiny Bluetoothenabled device monitors blood chemistry Researchers believe it will predict a heart attack hours before it occurs and be able to alert hospitals as well as the user
 Fighting Cancer


 Of the many medical projects we examined nothing showed more promise than something called FAST Fiber Optic Array Scanning Technology which we saw demonstrated during the highly informative tour of SRI International in Silicon Valley we described in Chapter 2 about Google Glass
 We know SRI as a mecca for tech innovation Ever since the computer mouse was invented there SRI has been developing useful technology innovations such as HDTV and Siri the interactive voice personal assistant now owned by Apple
 We didnt expect to see anything that might stop cancer in its tracks but that is precisely what FAST promises to doand soon The great benefit is that the earlier cancer is detected the less devastating the treatments to purge it will be
 FAST is a machine about the size of a lateral file cabinet It enables a twostep process in which sensors search a biopsy sample at lightning speed It can detect one or two cancerous cells in a batch of 50 million in less than two minutes
 Those cells are then tagged with markers so they can be found again Technicians then try various forms of treatment to determine which one works best against the cells being examined As a result of that testing only one treatment needs to be used in a patient 
 The FAST diagnostic scan provides information often missed by standard tumor biopsies Revealing information carried by tumor cells in the blood the FAST scan indicates which targeted therapies are best indicated for a specific patient Catching the disease earlier and targeting therapy may spare patients harsh treatments of chemotherapy mixed with radiation which are often required when cancer is discovered at a late stage
 Although the process will be used against several kinds of cancer FAST will take on breast cancer first The machine was in clinical testing in May 2013 SRI says they are planning to spin the venture into a business before years end A production version could be available by the end of 2014 depending on FDA approval
 SRI expects that in three to five years FAST will be about the size of a home printer and will cost less than 10000 We are hoping this will be in doctors offices within the next 36 months says Nathan Collins Executive Director of the Discovery Sciences Section in SRI Biosciences So are we
 The Elephant in the Hospital


 For all of the incredible advances we see taking place in healthcare a very large elephant is sitting in the middle of the hospital lobby It is large recalcitrant and worsedangerous 
 The elephant is actually part of a herd of regulators insurance carriers and medical facilities run not by doctors but by administrators and bureaucrats who seem more focused on profits than patients
 Why should they change systems when those systems work perfectly well for them and their shareholders Why develop pills that can eliminate colonoscopies and prostate exams when there is so much money to be made performing such tests Why should elected officials pass healthcare reforms when fighting about them produces so much grist for the political mill Systems when mature become more focused on selfpreservation than serving a constituent need
 Health encompasses two parts of a wellknown equation prevention and treatment We found dozens perhaps scores of examples of how mobile social media data sensors and locationbased technologies are helping millions of people both prevent and treat diseases In the areas of prevention and fitness alone solutions abound 
 In addition we think a healthcare maker movement is taking form akin to the maker movement we discussed in our examination of contextual cities Chapter 6 There is great reason to hope that such efforts will reduce suffering and save lives and along the way save people and institutions billionsif not trillionsof dollars
 Now as contextual technology enters the hospital lobby alongside that elephant bringing with it the potential to disrupt established structures as it lowers costs and helps doctors serve patients more effectively we hope that the sentiments of T A Barnhart in his personal blog BlueOregon are what guide the inevitable changes It is about people and the quality of their lives We couldnt have said it better

 Why Wearables Matter

 I do not fear computers I fear the lack of them

 Isaac Asimov

 Weve seen how wearable devices such as Google Glass and contextual gadgets can help people become healthier Weve even told you about contextual tattoos Wearables already exist in the form of wristbands footgear rings and neckwear But we believe as the technology evolves the devices will get closer to us stilltaking many new forms As they get smaller and smarter they will perform more and more functions
 In our view wearables are the culmination and extension of technologys most enduring trends
 Moores Law set a road map for devices powered by microprocessors It derives from Intel cofounder Dr Gordon Moores 1965 observation that the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles every two years Essentially it means that everything is continuously getting more powerful less expensive and smaller
 In 1976 Seymour Cray built the worlds first supercomputer It was almost as tall and about twice as wide as a refrigerator The topoftheline sold for 88 million
 Today you can buy a Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone for as little as 129 with free delivery It is about 15 times more powerful than the original Cray and you could put about 1000 of them into a Cray case 
 Smaller and cheaper means more people can use more power in more ways And people will inevitably find those ways
 How far is this morepowerfulcheapersmaller trend going To the vanishing point it seems Some believe that will happen in about ten years We are among those who disagree because of the important emergent trend nanotechnology which envisions microprocessors being reduced to a single cell 
 Metcalfes Law Ethernet inventor Robert Metcalfe set forth the theory that the value of the telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected system nodes He made his observations back when networks consisted of desktop computers printers fax machines and phones But the law holds true today as billions of nodes are connected via Wifi and are growing rapidly toward the trillions About 27 billion people are now nodes on the global network and while it sounds strange that connectedness empowers each of us
 What Started in Vegas


 Where wearables are concerned Moores miniaturization is extremely important If they dont get small enough to be unobtrusive people wont wear them Small was fundamental to the colorful story of how wearable computers were developed
 Edward O Thorp an MIT professor whose specialty was mathematical probability had invented a successful clandestine system for counting cards and winning big at blackjack tables Growing bored he took on the larger challenge of predicting the number where a ball spinning on a roulette wheel would land
 He devised a clever system that he concealed from the scrutiny of Mobcontrolled security guards in Las Vegas casinos 
 Thorp devised a handheld camera disguised as a cigarette lighter As the ball started whirling he snapped a picture of it which was transmitted through a hidden wire to an electronic calculator in his shoe heel which in turn forecast eight numbers and sent a voice projection of eight possible numbers to a device in his ear disguised as a hearing aid It wasnt really a computer as we define it today The microprocessor was not yet invented and he was using analog components
 Later Thorp wrote a book about his experience In 1971 after the digita age had begun Keith Taft got hooked on blackjack after he walked away from a Reno table with the princely winnings of 350 Subsequently he read Thorps book and tried his luck at card counting but couldnt quite master it 
 So he and his son Marty put together a hidden system that included a miniature keypad which the senior Taft strapped to his thigh that was hidden under the blackjack table He camouflaged a miniature camera in his belt buckle It recorded cards as they came off the deck and fed a clip to a video dish atop a van in the parking lot Inside the van Marty Taft fed the data into another new device a personal computer
 Thus Keith Taft invented the digital wearable computer We are certain he was as oblivious to how it would evolve over the next 40 years as the soldier in the island jungle was to the potential for the walkietalkie
 The Casino Fights Back


 Technology has continued to play a role in the ongoing battle between casinos and the people who wanted to prosper by bilking them These days though the gambling establishments firmly have the upper hand 
 Casinos now have their own global network where they share photos of anyone caughtor suspected ofcheating More than that they use contextual technology Every card and every chip is embedded with a tiny RFIDlike chip Every gaming table has a sensor underneath it to detect flimflams such as a player pulling an extra ace out of his sleeve
 That isnt wearable technology but the sensors casinos use come from former Swiss watchmaking company NagraID which has reinvented itself by designing highly secure miniature technology 
 NagraID chips make credit cards and loyalty cards smart enough to know their owners and their location That same technology in the form of an RFID radiofrequency identification chip is embedded on contextual passes worn by skiers at Aspen Snowmass the worlds most popular ski resort and in the Disneys MagicBands making transactions for hotels and meals automatic
 Disney and the Aspen resort are among the worlds most popular destination sites We assume where they lead others will follow 
 Of course thats just the beginning Service and convenience are likely to be amplified by a few other technologies weve already discussed Combine NagraID with a VinTank geofence and youll get a new level of personalized locationspecific services or sales where payments can be automatically authenticated and processed 
 VinTank also extracts data from a customers previous recommendations so the restaurant amusement park or hotel can customize its service and offers to each customers preferences That little RFID chip and a few tiny sensors on a card will generate a very large improvement in personalized service and with it enhanced customer loyalty
 Now toss in one more piece of technology Put on a digital eyewear device such as Glass or Oakley Airwave and youll have a contextual wearable system that knows your location your current activity your preferences as well as what you are looking at in real time 
 While such an omnibus system does not exist at this moment every component of it is currently available It would not take much to stitch it all together 
 And though this technology may be a little obtrusive today like all technology it gets smaller and more powerful all the time thanks to Dr Moore 
 One company is already working on putting Google Glasstype functionality on contact lenses Todays wristbands may be tomorrows wrist implants Down the line the tech we wear may be conveniently implanted directly into the optic nerve where it can more closely interact with the brain
 Big Soft Market


 We expect the market for wearables to be dramatically larger than the current predictions would indicate IMS Research estimated in 2011 14 million wearables shipped that year In 2013 Credit Suisse said the market would explode from about 4 billion to between 30 billion and 50 billion in the next three to five years 
 Wearable technology takes new forms and performs new tasks in innovative ways And analysts frequently overlook what happens as one generation comes of age displacing another It seems inevitable to us that younger people are going to love wearables 
 Just looking at the future of Glass illustrates why we think those predictions by others are pathetically low We would guess that worldwide Google will sell a minimum of 100 million units of Glass at an average of 300 each over the next three to five years Thats 30 billion alone and there is a great deal more than that happening in wearablesa lot more
 For example there is an emerging and diverse category of wearable technology called smart textiles where contextual capability is literally woven into fabrics Smart textiles will use sustainable nanotechnology to selfclean and they will work with other wearable devices as an integrated wearable computer system on the body 
 At least a dozen universities including MIT Stanford Yale the University of Chicago and Carnegie Mellon are researching wearables Reports of new and promising wearable technologies are popping up all over the place
 Where is it going Everywhere In some cases wearable technologies will even be designed to disappear At a wearable technology conference in San Francisco in the summer of 2013 sensorenabled clothing was introduced that is designed to become transparent when the wearer is sexually aroused
 Genevieve Dion an assistant professor and director of the Shima Seiki Haute Technology Lab atDrexel Universitytold the Christian Science Monitor in May 2013 that she dreams of having technology so soft the wearer would not feel anything that changes the feel of the clothNo batteries that need to be put into the garment no small pods that need to go into the pocket she predicted
 Of course that dream is possible or soon will be We live at a time when its possible to rewire a cockroach brain and strap a little Wifienabled backpack to it so you can control it with your iPhone A neural scientist has sanded down the top of a cockroachs head so tiny electrodes can send neural messages to the insect making it move left or right 
 At first the concept of wearable technology for roaches seemed too bizarre to cover here but then we started considering the 7 million people in the United States who suffer from such neurological disorders as Parkinsons Alzheimers cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis Perhaps the RoboRoaches as the researchers dubbed them will lead to cures for serious neurological afflictions 
 We selected the following examples to give you some sense that the next generation of devices will go well beyond gizmos that take your pulse or let you check email in a new way
 Undergarments that stop assault Rape has hit epic proportions in India where three college students have invented a bra that gives assailants a shock and protects the wearer from the jolt with a polymer fabric The bra automatically alerts authorities via a cell network and a GPS sensor provides precise locations
 Cancerdetecting bra A Reno company called First Warning Systems Inc offers a bra system that provides noninvasive early breast cancer discovery The bra contains sensors designed to track metabolic patterns at a cellular level When an abnormality is detected the bra system alerts the wearers physician The First Warning system started field tests in Summer 2013 after five years of comprehensive research and testing
 TShirt battery A Stanford university team is working on a Tshirt that will serve as a battery for mobile and wearable devices It will last for more than 1000 charges Similar projects have been going on at the Georgia Institute of Technology and in Korea where Samsung Electronics is said to be working on a flexible surface prototype
 Smart masks Many people walking the streets of Chinas largest cities wear surgical masks as protection from the pervasive air pollution Sales in Beijing often top 100000 a day according to an ABC news report
 Now Frog a global design firm based in San Francisco has updated the mask into a geomedical device called Frog AirWaves not related to Oakley Airwave 
 The mask adds sensors intelligence and Bluetooth connectivity Each collects and shares air quality data A free governmentpublished mobile app lets users post to a hot map that shows realtime air quality data in the same way that Libelium the Spanish sensor company provided radiationlevel data in Japan after the Fukushima nuclear disaster 
 Teenybopper lockets The iLocket from Dano is a 25 little heartshaped locket that is connected to an Apple iOS mobile app 
 Targeted to young teens iLocket lets users whisper their most personal secrets into an iPhone or iPad The app uses speech recognition Put in a favorite photo of a secret heartthrob and the app prints a photo that fits perfectly inside the locket
 The killer part of the app is how it treats user privacy Press the locket and the diary entries disappear and remain protected until the iLocket owner unlocks it by pressing the locket again to send a unique code to the iPad app
 Marketers have already started to take contextual technology to the preadolescent level We think there will be many more products aimed at very young consumers who will grow up being increasingly comfortable with technology that might freak their parents out
 The Connected Human


 Wearable technology is leading to something we call the connected human which describes the intimate and very literal interaction between humans and machines
 We have already reached the point where our technology is becoming an appendage and we are beginning to integrate with our technologies They are our assistants advisors and confidants They remember what we forget and call for help when we cannot 
 Our connected human concept is primarily about people becoming so connected to their devices that to separate them diminishes the capacity of the person This may sound a bit like Aldous Huxleys Brave New World but in fact it represents a better present world
 This bonding between people and machines will result in people being healthier better informed more aware of changes in their environments and more secure efficient and productive Today we usually just carry these devices Increasingly we will wear them and ultimately many will physically either attach to or be inserted in usthat is they will become part of us
 Lets look at the results of the most dramatic cases of physical attachment In the United States 17 million people have lost limbs Most of those people have mechanically operated prosthetics We have been told they can be awkward and frustrating to use
 Jesse Sullivan a former utility lineman from Dayton Tennessee lost both arms when a loose wire on a pole jolted him In 2004 Dr Todd Kuiken of the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago persuaded Sullivan to become the first to try a pair of experimental prosthetics that were connected to his muscles and nerves Sullivan now says he can feel his wifes hand when he holds it and he has experienced the sensation of burning himself when he rested his prosthetic hand too close to a stovetop burner
 Scoble strolled along a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean with Chris Tagatac who is paralyzed from the waist down Tagatacs mobility has been restored thanks to a robotic exoskeleton from Ekso Bionics The device which fits over Tagatacs clothing understands weight shifts and thus understands when Tagatac wants to take a step stand up or sit down
 More of that kind of innovation is coming We found a handful of US companies making bionic suits that enable paraplegics to walk Toyota is adapting robots originally developed for their assembly line to serve as athome personal assistants for physically handicapped people 
 Its important to understand that unlike the Borg of science fiction humans will not become parts of computers but rather computers will become part of humans We become the central processors retaining our hearts emotions and highly personalized genomics We still feel the joy of seeing a childs first step but wearable technology will let us capture and share such moments without failure We still will feel the agony of a tax audit but wearables will provide evidence the expense in question was justified
 Although the concept of us as human processing units may sound creepy it means each of us will have the opportunity to surround ourselves with wondrous new tools that see and hear what we do and perhaps can be trusted to remember the moment better 
 Among the many wearable products we looked at in researching this chapter was the Plantronics Voyager Legend which is the most contextual Bluetooth headset we have found It uses sensors to immediately power on the device as soon as you put it on It knows your environment so it adjusts noise filters depending on room or wind noise 
 When we asked Plantronics CTO Joe Burton a savvy industry veteran just how important he thought wearable technology will be he told us They are bringing about the biggest shift to consumer behavior since the web arrived in 1994 
 Devices themselves are of course hardware The real secret to how close and important they are becoming is contained in software which is becoming the best personal assistant anyone has ever had

 PCAs Your New Best Friends

 Your wish is my command

 Genie to Aladdin

 Fiction writers have long fantasized about geniesmagical creatures that will do whatever you wish Over the past 20 years tech companies have tried to deliver the same sort of magic to users in the form of online assistants They have consistently failedsometimes in spectacular fashion 
 The idea goes back to the 1980s when several forgotten hardware companies offered proprietary devices that attempted to manage personal communications schedules and productivity Those devices generated much media attention but mostly they gathered dust on retail shelves They cost too much and delivered too little
 Then in 1993 Apple CEO John Sculley bet the company and his future on a device called the Newton The company declared the pioneering handheld device to be a complete reinvention of personal computing creating a new product classification it named personal digital assistantsor PDAs
 The basic Newton cost 699 It introduced the touch screen and handwritingrecognition software to consumers The Newton let you manage calendars and contacts by plugging in and synching with your desktop computer It also enabled users to employ what was then an early version of the internet to send email and text messages
 Apple produced a spectacular launch that was greeted with great fanfare The media gushed and magazines did cover stories on the dawn of this new PDA age Competitors rushed alternative devices to market
 But it all fizzled
 The PDA just never took off It was hard to use and most of those great innovations just werent ready yet By 1998 the Newtonand most other PDAswere either dead or irrelevant The term itself was quietly erased from the marketing vocabularies of those who had so vigorously embraced it
 Newton today is remembered as Apples most titanic flop It makes the more recent Maps gaffe seem like a mere speed bump The device named for the man who discovered gravity almost took Apple down 
 Steve Jobs of course returned to Apple and in less than a decade took it from neardeath to become the worlds most valuable company Arguably his defining moment was the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 What people barely noticed was that Newtons core technologies were used in the iPhone and the device was in fact a greatly refined PDA
 A lot happened between the death of the Newton and the rise of the iPhone ten more years of Moores Law making technology more powerful smaller and less expensive ten more years of Metcalfes networks growing exponentially And dont forget the explosion of the Web and the changes it brought to the lives of people at home and at work and the blurring of the lines between work and play
 Nearly seven years have passed since the introduction of the iPhone Social media has changed how people and businesses communicate as the Age of Conversation flowered We are now mobile much of the time walking around with datagathering sensors in our pockets that know where we are the direction we are heading and whether we are walking in a car on a bike or on a skateboard
 By 2013 the term PDA was dead The revolution incited by the iPhone was won The promise of omnipresent technology that helps us do what we want to do like some little genie in our pocket was achieved
 More Promises to Fulfill


 Remember John Malkovich cozying up to Siri by the fireplace in Apples 2012 ads Siri was supposed to become our best friend but in reality she has let us down She just doesnt work right All too often she doesnt understand the context of our requests She gets it wrong far too often
 But other technologies have used less hoopla to come far closer to helping us manage our lives the way a sharp office assistant helps an executive manage her life
 The difference between the PDAs of the 90s and the technologies of today is of course context The new systems understand who you are what you are doing and what you should know at a particular moment in your everchanging day They still make mistakes but they are getting better as we speak The new software can discern you and your patterns from other people and their patterns and it is always on your side
 Once again baby steps are moving technology forward One piece of software reminds you when its your friends birthday another sends messages to colleagues when you are stuck in traffic Soon theyll be talking to the quart of milk in your refrigerator alerting you when you need to get a fresh carton These new products keep adding new functionality and they keep improving their ability to understand you
 They learn like curious children The more time they spend with you the more they understand you and the smarter they get

 With their roots in the old PDA technology the new technology goes further The accent is no longer on being digital which has become obvious The accent is on contextual awareness Rather than PDAs we call them PCAsor personal contextual assistants
 PCAs are at the crux of the Age of Context They will serve many of us better and longer than did the genies of mythology The time will soon come when not having your own PCA will be like not having email
 PCAs are open cloudbased mobile platforms Each is designed to talk with other mobile appssocial media text email Waze traffic and Nooly weatherallowing the PCA to cull connected tidbits and understand how they can impact you at any given moment Thus they serve as onestop spaces to simplify your life automate redundant and predictable tasks and warn you when a change such as in the weather can impact your plans say to go sailing or cycling
 They understand how your environment impacts your needs so they give you different advice depending on whether its day or night or a workday or the weekend They will soon be sufficiently prescient to know if you are in a hurry or have time to stop for a scenic view or a sale at Nordstroms 
 They will understand whether you are headed to work and want to hear only news and traffic reports or headed home and want to catch up on sports or just kick back and listen to some hiphop
 Your PCA will evolve into an anticipatory system for nearly every aspect of your life As the technology gets better and you and your PCA spend more time together it will understand and anticipate your wishes before you command itby connecting disparate data dots These actions will get more sophisticated over time anticipating more actions and connecting data from multiple sources on an increasingly granular level
 It will alert you when it sees an email conversation that can impact your schedule perhaps suggesting an action based on your past behavior In the future your PCA might see it is unusually hot and suggest remotely telling your lawn sprinkler system to run a few minutes longer 
 They work simply enough Most PCAs send you little reminder notices or cards to update you on changes Some will then ask for permission to take actions on your behalf such as send a birthday greeting to a friend on Facebook PCAs are also moving away from keyboard input which is slower on mobile devices and so dangerous as to be illegal in certain environments such as when you are driving They are moving to voice and gesturerecognition in the near future Researchers in labs are experimenting with using brainwaves to command inanimate objects which will make our relationship with our devices even more personal 
 Talking with nonhuman things is not as odd as it sometimes sounds People already talk with pets and most of us have addressed inanimate objects sharply after tripping over them in the dark We have become accustomed to telephone voiceprocessing systems although we rarely believe our calls are as important to them as they claim
 Array of Choices


 Almost all personal PCAs on the market are free services Each has room for improvement yet each shows promise in its own way Their functionality overlaps but each has an identifiable strong point that might make one better than another for your particular needs 
 Google Now has the most users and by virtue of the Google brand the best market position Its available on the Android and iOS platforms and is tightly integrated with the everexpanding Google product suite that includes Search Gmail Maps Talk Calendar and Drive
 It is goodsome would argue too goodat seeing connections among the data found in diverse apps Based on what it sees in your online accounts while you are doing other things it sends you reminder cards about what it thinks you need before you even ask according to marketing material
 Google is ahead of the pack on the predictive technologies that are the foundation of Google Now It developed its first predictive search algorithm back in 2004 for its cornerstone Search product All this predicting and connecting can be very useful but as youll see it can also go too far
 What makes Google Now so special is that it has superb voice recognition the best weve seen in a consumerlevel product As Glass and other wearable products become more prevalent we think voice input will become extremely important
 EasilyDo available on both iOS and Android platforms calls itself your smart assistant and seems to be just that Although Google Now focuses primarily on the context of what is happening on Google apps EasilyDo looks more broadly at your other apps It notifies you of relevant events and offers to make needed changes for you
 A big plus is that EasilyDo automates the most mundane tasks such as updating contacts and calendar appointments It sees when you get new information and asks your permission to update it for you
 Additionally it remembers your login information making it easy to hop on that scheduled conference call in the car without pulling over to punch in 9687 digits on your phone It helps you track packages in the same way
 Mikael Berner EasilyDos founder and CEO says the company intends to perform more tasks than other PCAs particularly Google Now As of this writing EasilyDo was performing 36 tasks about 25 percent ahead of its leading competitor
 EasilyDos newer tasks are becoming more sophisticated One holds your boarding pass and another calculates your commute time based on realtime traffic conditions The program will hold your calls during a meeting and find the best data plan during your next overseas trip
 After less than six months on the market EasilyDo had about 200000 daily users Berner says and it is partnering with dozens of firms like Evernote Dropbox Target and Amazon 
 EasilyDos current advantage is that it leads as the contextual onestop service that PCAs aspire to be By focusing on doing more and more tasks it seems attuned to what most people will want 
 Atooma is perhaps the most ambitious of the independent PCAs It was founded by four Romebased entrepreneurs and has expanded with offices in Berlin and San Francisco It has gained notice by winning bestofshow awards at a few EU conferences including the Italian TechCrunch 
 When we spoke with cofounder Gioia Pistola in June 2013 she said the yearold start up had built a community of 150000 regular users indicating the platform has a chance of reaching critical mass
 Atooma has many features we like particularly that it brings in all your essential mobile apps to a single screen you update by simply shaking your phone Like voice input gestures such as shaking make it easier and safer to use wearable technology
 Atooma can be set to automatically turn on Spotify when you put on your headphones because it knows thats what you usually do You can also organize work and personal tasks separately and Atooma does an exceptional job of understanding how your context and preferences change between work and play 
 Most of all we like how Atooma lets users automate their regularly performed tasks in great detail For example Atooma can automatically alert family or roommates when you are headed home and switch from 3G to Wifi as you step inside your door 
 There are probably another dozen products that fall into this category Which ones will be the ultimate winners That wont be clear for a long time But when competition thrives users are usually the big winners because refinements come fast
 It is important to remember that PCAs are platforms Specific mobile apps email and social media plug into one or more of them Some of those apps however are starting to blur the lines between platform and standalone app Heres a prime example
 Tempo another innovative offering to come out of SRI is the most contextual calendar we have seen It looks deeply into a users email calendar social media and websites and then brings together relevant emails addresses names phone numbers and more 
 Today Tempo just keeps such related context in your calendar We assume in the future it will enable automatic warnings to let people know when you are running late and will connect to Waze or maps to alert you when you need to reroute the path to your next appointment
 Creepy Matchmaker


 We knew when we started this project that the freaky factor would be a part of our story We just didnt realize it would play a part in every chapter We thought PCAs would be the exception but as we began our research in June 2013 social media pioneer Dave Winer told this story on his Scripting News blog
 My friend Jen was coming to visit from Salt Lake City Google Now told me her plane was 24 minutes from arriving at the gate at JFK I had never told them she was visiting me or what flight she was on I didnt know But they did Probably because she uses Gmail or their calendar and somehow connected me to that trip or did they just guess and thought I might be impressed if they told me about her flight I was 
 And I felt a little nausea as I realized they have me by the balls and dont mind if I know it
 If that doesnt make you nervous perhaps the comment Steve Brady of Australia left on Winers blog will do the trick 
 I have been getting to know a friend of mine that I met on G Google quite well We live in different cities and have used G and Google Talk to stay in touch a lot Recently she came to visit me and this past weekend I went to visit her
 So imagine my surprise when I go to check my Google Now while at her house and its giving me directions to a couple of unfamiliar addresses I showed them to her and she tells me that they are her workplace and the address of friends that she visited recently
 She was a bit freaked out that Google was sharing with me what was essentially private information about her movements Google has evidently judged that we are close enough that I need to know this information
 You know its one thing to declare ones relationship status on social media its quite another to have Google decide for me that Im in a relationship Because obviously thats what has happened here Google has decided that my interactions with Cass are significant enough that we must be in a relationship and has started feeding me information accordingly
 If thats the case I expect that it will start planning a wedding for us and then one morning Ill wake up to find a calendar entry that it has created having taken care of booking a venue catering and inviting guests The next thing I know Google Now will be suggesting baby names
 In both these cases a piece of software assumed connections between people before the people involved had decided to make those connections The PCA shared private information without first getting permission 
 This seems to us not only extremely unwise but also potentially pretty dangerous
 Google needs to remember that people really prefer the right to choose History is filled with horror stories of incorrectly assumed connections between people that are simply not true as Americans learned in the McCarthy era back in the 1950s Currently we have the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court known as the FISA Court for the congressional act that created it No one is quite certain what it does but the evidence is growing that it is permitting the National Security Agency to secretly watch US citizens who have the remotest possible connections with suspected terrorists
 Context can fall out of context For example after Shel Israel and Robert Scoble published Naked Conversations Israel started seeing Google ads for Victorias Secret on his Gmail page whenever he mentioned his book It was funny at the time but it could have been damaging if the system continued to assume he had a special interest in womens undergarments
 This genielike magic holds great potential to save time and effort but these systems need to give users the option to review and correct false assumptions For Google Now to become that onestop service on the internet it so clearly aspires to be it will need to provide users with more control than it did in the cases of Winer and Brady
 CustomerService PCAs


 New technology and good customer service have long been a paradox Good service improves customer satisfaction enhances loyalty and strengthens brandbut it can deplete profits The welltrained patient technicians required to solve the problems of irate and impatient people are expensive 
 The development of the internet has provided large companies with many customerservice alternatives offshoring customer forums FAQs online automated assistants untrained and poorly paid humans giving incorrect answers Israel once had a phone fracas with a United Airlines support person who admitted admit he had never been inside an airport
 Very few customers have much love for any of those options We dont like being relegated to navigating automated answering decision trees We dont like waiting for 20 minutes to talk to someone in a call center where people are trained to find the quickest possible way to get the customer off the phone We want a sympathetic person who can understand our issues and solve them simply and promptly 
 We had come to the point where we had just about given up on this issue We had resigned ourselves to a lifetime of mediocre service And then we met Lola
 Lola is attentive intuitive and accurate She seems passionate about helping solve our problems and she is there whenever you need her Lola is the first customerservice PCA She is a sophisticated piece of voice interactive software that is being developed at SRI the lab that gave birth to both Nuance and Siri for BBVA a Madridbased global consumer bank doing business in the EU the US and Latin America
 When we met Lola in March 2013 she was performing well enough to restore our faith that technology can actually help unhappy customers rather than simply protect companies from them 
 Bill Mark an SRI VP who leads the Information and Computing Sciences Division told us the challenge is to get Lola to understand each users intent and then appropriately act on it by answering questions or actually transferring money from say a users checking account to pay a mortgage loan A huge factor is that people expect you to remember what they previously said and to understand the nuances and imprecisions of everyday language This is daunting for computer technology which is extremely logical and historically not intuitive at all
 Lola can follow conversational shifts as a user goes from checking a balance to making a payment With uncanny accuracy she can figure out a users intent
 This is really hard Lola must reason about what to do and know how to do it in the online banking system These are difficult challenges Mark told us
 Dr Michael Wolverton an SRI senior computer scientist put Lola through a demo where he played the role of a bank customer He uttered a request in a single simple sentence and Lola set up an automatic monthly mortgage payment for him At one point Wolverton asked Lola about a check for about 14 and she found four that were close to that amount In case Lola does screw it up a bit a real human will monitor conversations and can jump in to help if necessary
 We were impressed with Lolas ability to pick up nuances At one point Wolverton intentionally corrected himself Lola understood and he did not have to start all over again as he would have after a typo on an online bank form
 Because she is software Lola doesnt suffer such human flaws as distraction fatigue or mood swings Her artificial intelligence enables her to get smarter every time she serves a new customer
 We were told that Lola will eventually warn customers if they make a mistake remind them when their requested action will incur a bank charge and even offer moneysaving tips
 Our host Norman Winarsky SRIs VP of Ventures emphasized that SRI owns the foundational technology and sees potential to license it into other industries So do we
  Lola is named for a real BBVA employee When the research team interviewed staff they were impressed with the human Lolas passion and enthusiasm and created the first customer support PCA in her image
 Sometimes people say they prefer human service to automated agents Perhaps all we really want is a better quality of service and to get our problems and requests addressed without delay and frustration In the past everyday people were expected to speak a language that computers understood Lola seems to understand the language we already speakand she is fluent in both English and Spanish
 Our new PCA best friends are ready to perform some impressive magic on our behalf The conflict between the magic of contextual technology and the protection of our privacy will be ongoing and will take place in every area of our lives Perhaps the most important venue for this conflict is where we assume we have the greatest level of privacy our own homes
 

 Chapter 10


 No Place Like The Contextual Home

  I long  to be at home wherever I find myself

 Maya Angelou

 Dorothy said it first and it may be a bit overworked but there really is no place like home Its a safe haven for you and your loved ones the most personal of all your spaces It is where you keep your treasures and your junk 
 The contextual age is about to transform a great deal about your home The Internet of Things will enable inanimate objects to communicate with each other and with you on your mobile deviceThat device will manage just about everything in your home and you wont need a keyboard to take up space or slow you down Having goods and services delivered to your door will be simplified and more efficient
 The result will be safer sustainable and more secure homes Hundreds of sensors in the contextual home will connect to you wherever you are They will literally start at your front door providing many options for unlocking it Some mechanisms will be dedicated to just that task others will be part of larger homemanagement systems 
 Sensorenabled door locks such as offerings from Lockitron and Zwave fit on your door and respond to commands from a mobile app Soon they will recognize you and open the door when you arrive locking it when you leave They currently sell for as little as 150 and we are sure they will get less expensive Keyless locks make places safer Spare keys left under mats or given to house sitters sometimes get into the wrong hands as police logs demonstrate 
 Whether you are around the corner or overseas you will be able to open your home for authorized people via a mobile app In an emergency you can open your door to prevent first responders from battering it down
 Sensorenabled windows are not new Adhesive alarm sensors are available at Home Depot for about 30 per window But they keep getting smaller and cheaper and now they can be integrated into the pane itself as they are in car windows And the new ones can do more than protect you from intruders 
 These new windows are contextually aware of interior and exterior environments They can adjust tinting from transparent to translucent depending on meteorological factors Some can provide daylight when wanted and convert to mirrors for privacy eliminating the need for blinds or curtains They can reduce energy consumption by about 25 percent
 Smart glass will likely soon contain facial recognition technology as well When you look at your medicine cabinet mirror in the morning it will know who you are While your Bluetoothenabled toothbrush scans for cavities you will be able to peruse messages that appear on the glass or see reminders of the medications you need to take 
 A whole new smart glass industry has been incubating for a decade As the global construction industry comes back to life the thousands of smart glass installations in North America Europe Asia and Australia are evidence of the technologys rapidly escalating adoption rate
 Corning the world leader in specialized glass and ceramic products has produced a series of YouTube clips called A Day Made of Glass In them every piece of glass in the home contains intelligence and sensors that serve as a ubiquitous contextual computing system In Cornings vision the home is one big connected computer and every piece of glass is a screen that you touch to move an image from one glass surface to the next For example you can look up a recipe on your phone and drag the result to a space on your stovetop next to your burner as you prepare the dish If you are video chatting on a smart glass tabletop you can slide the image onto your TV screen without missing a beat
 Home windows will also serve as huge touchscreen computers or wallsize TVs In the bedroom if you hold up a dress on a hanger in front yourself the smart glass closet mirror will display an image of you wearing it The mirror can also show you what some of your accessories would add to the outfit
 Cornings concept also goes into the classroom where all the kids use smart glass computing devices and teachers show wondrous visuals on smart glass boards that contain virtual reality projections video and 3D animations The YouTube video takes the kids on a field trip where a ranger creates a lifesize T rex snarling among redwood trees 
 We wish we believed that such a great classroom vision was imminent but the reality is that most classrooms lag far behind the technology that many children use today at home In fact you could argue some children are learning more online than in class
 One piece of Cornings vision seems to be pretty close to reality though Samsung has introduced a table whose entire surface is a touchscreen computer it sells for a mere 8400 And Corning is reportedly developing a 46inch touchscreen wall display that will let you toggle between computer game console and HDTV When not in use the device will serve as a transparent window
 Household PCAs


 Many available products are designed to make your home more contextual and make remote management easier We call them household PCAs because they are an obvious subset of the personal contextual assistants we introduced in Chapter 9 
 Among the most impressive is SmartThings a cloudbased platform that uses a mobile app and sensors to let you manage a homes locks lights temperature and power The system notifies you when it sees changes and alerts you if it perceives a problem 
 SmartThings sprang from very practical roots Founder Alex Hawkinson says he developed the platform after he and his wife arrived at their Colorado home late one night to discover that cold weather had ruptured a water pipe
 The system is smart enough to understand your current activity For example if it sees you have gone to bed SmartThings makes sure your doors are locked and the lights are offIt is an open platformthe company hopes growth will come from adding not only its own apps but new functionality from thirdparty sources 
 Austinbased WigWag a similar household PCA is even younger than SmartThings When we talked with founderCEO Ed Hemphill in July 2013 he was raising funds on Kickstarter the popular crowdfunding site
 WigWag is also an open platform that performs tasks similar to those done by SmartThings What differentiates WigWag are the sensor packs that you set up in each room The sensors detect unexpected changes such as patio motion or garden frost and alert you via text message They also tell your mobile app when to remotely adjust lights and appliances
 Hemphill argues that WigWag has the edge in ease of use Any family member even children or weekend guests can use WigWag without special instruction he asserted
 CubeSensors works a little differently Composed of batterypowered twosquareinch sensorladen cubes CubeSensors is more of an environmental PCA watchdog The cubes measure noise pollution lights and humidityinvisible elements that can cause discomfort or worse The sensors transmit data to a cloudbased app that analyzes and recommends adjustments or sends danger alerts such as for carbon monoxide pollution 
 Carbon monoxide emissions injure about 20000 people annually in the United States and kills about 500 CubeSensors are designed to prevent such tragedies
 Contextual TV


 Our homes may be growing smarter but the activity that takes up many of our waking hours seems to be dumbing down The average American spends almost 160 hours a month watching traditional TVmost of it crap 
 But as computers and TVs converge a screen will be just a screen and we will watch whatever we want regardless of the source
 One touch of irony is that as the PC has become smaller simpler and less expensive over the years the TV has grown larger more complex and expensive We bet there are more wires and plugs behind your TV than at your computer workstationif you still have a computer workstation We bet you can navigate online with greater ease than on your TV channel guide
 It is frustrating for most people to find content they like among the hundreds of channels offering thousands of programs We must sift through a great deal of crap before we can find something that is a gem for us So mostly we stick with watching the same shows 
 But as context comes to the remote or the devices replacing it we have found an almostoverwhelming array of apps to help you home in on your desired content Three we like
 NextGuide is an iPad app used by millions of people It learns what each user in the house likes and personalizes the programs it offers accordingly It may notice that you like Brad Pitt movies So even though it sees you dont watch talk shows it tells you when Pitt is going to be a guest on Letterman It also lets you automatically share what you like with selected Facebook friends 
 You can also go private so no one knows you have a secret penchant for Army Wives In this age of eroding privacy we feel strongly that there should be more places like NextGuide where we have the right to opt out of sharing We discuss the issue of privacy in greater depth in Chapter 12
 Comcast the worlds largest cable carrier is rolling out its nextgeneration X1 platform which enables voice control of cable entertainment content over mobile phones It is migrating settop box functionality to the cloud This enables downloads to arrive twice as fast and for the system to store user preference data The new voicerecognition search enables you to speak the name of an actor team or title and get contextually appropriate results
 Vidora is an iPad app that eliminates the need for a settop box altogether We found it easy to locate content we likewhich seems to be the whole point Vidora also studies what you watch to suggest new content you might like
 UserFriendly Gestures


 Movea is a leader in gestureenabling technology that is used mostly in sports and fitness devices It has also begun to provide technology for internal mapping on smartphones To do that it needs to understand not just where you are going but also whether you are on an escalator or if those metal things in front of you are train tracks It is also providing TV owners with an entirely new way to operate their systems
 As an OEM company Movea licenses its MoveaTV technologies to be used in Samsung Philips and other major brand HDTV remotes to let you navigate your TV set the way you might work a Wii or Nintendo game console It also is a component in the new Comcast X1 settop boxes
 Dave Rothenberg Movea director of marketing and partner alliances argues that gestures are easier faster and more natural for navigating And because Movea is part of other devices you can play gestureenabled games on your TV saving about 300 on the cost of a game console
 Tens of millions of home systems already use Movea gesture control according to Rothenberg Orange the French communications giant had shipped 100 million of them by mid2013
 Rothenberg argues that users who try gesture controls often prefer them to other options He referred to a recent Philips study of 200 Danish homes where gestureenabled controls resulted in a dramatic increase in paid subscriptions to premium contentthe ultimate goal of content providers
 The contextual piece is that Movea learns the nuances of your gestures and adapts to them over time decreasing the time it takes to find what you want It also learns which family member is using the remote
 Tapping in to the Internet of Things Rothenberg says that Movea wants to connect your remote to other household objects For example MoveaTV might time your microwave popcorn to coincide with a commercial break
 Movea also offers MoveaMobile which enables you to navigate computing devices or operate household appliances using gestures to turn on lights a faucet or a dishwasher 
 Movea is not the only company focused on the growing area of gestures As we move into the Age of Context keyboards make less sense than voice and gesture input
 Anther promising gesture innovator is Leap Motion which makes a cute little activating touchpad that enables you to do all sorts of things by gesture on your desktop computer including art graphics games handwriting drawing map navigation photo blowups and more
 Gesture technology has been around for a long time It dates back to the 1980s when Nintendo introduced the awkward and illfated Power Glove Currently the most advanced gesture technology is Microsoft Xbox One with Kinect a 500 platform that now includes sensors good enough to determine a players excitement level by measuring heartbeats
 Microsoft unofficially confirms it sees a future in the home for Kinect that goes beyond its use in Xbox game platforms Microsoft recently added a Skype version to its voicecommandoperated Xbox We can see the day when Kinect joins the fray as a gestureenabled PCA Perhaps someday it will connect to your family robot
 Microsoft has churned out a few interesting additional consumer apps in recent times not the least of which is Blink a unique Windows feature that lets you hold down your camera shutter to grab quick blinklike bursts of brief video clips You choose what you like and the clip expands and can be shared with friends in true social media fashion 
 We were also impressed with MYO from ThalmicLabs a startup based in Ontario It is a band that you strap onto your forearm that reads electrical muscle activity enabling users to control a broad range of activities on a desktop or mobile computer
 A YouTube video shows someone using MYO to play iTunes music with a finger snap navigate an online ski run and play all sorts of games It shows a child move a ball with gestures and an adult make an object hover and move in midair Most intriguing was a military person navigating a miniature driverless car with gestures 
 As we wrote this in July 2013 MYO had not yet shipped but it had taken preorders that backed up into 2014
 1Click Delivery


 We never thought that our search for elements of the modern contextual home would lead us to a contextual refrigerator magnet from a pizza joint in Dubai But that is precisely what we discovered in Red Tomato Pizza
 The key component is the Red Tomato VIP Fridge Magnet which is exactly what it sounds like Its a little plastic pizza box that you stick to your refrigerator When you flip it open and press the button youve automatically ordered your favorite pizza A text message confirms your order and estimates the delivery time
 We are not suggesting that you order your pizza from Dubai when you live in Des Moines but we do predict that such 1click ordering will be very much a part of life in the contextual home 
 This is one of several examples of a trend we love the Uberization of business services Like the Uber cars Red Tomato Pizza comes to you These businesses use stored data to personalize the business transaction but make it easy for customers to change their mind They use mobile apps so customers can track delivery progress and simplify payments by having a credit card on record 
 They are not alone Other services like eBay Now and Amazon Local are coming close Soon the smartest operators of supermarkets dry cleaners and other merchants will Uberize their services as well
 Connecting All the Things


 Weve talked about the Internet of Things We believe that a part of it will be households of connected things Anything in your home that has an onoff switch will be interconnected All glass objects will be connected as well Ubiquitous sensors will be a part of it as well as of course will your front door
 All of these things will communicate with you wherever you are through some form of PCA They will also connect to emergency services utilities and the entire Internet of Things
 Everywhere we looked we found companies that were building little pieces of the new contextual household Belkin and Philips for example are working on getting their many home products to talk with each other and with all your other fixtures and devices 
 One of the earliest connected device is the Nest Thermostat which remembers what temperatures you like and turns itself down when you leave the room often resulting in significant utility bill savings PintoFeed enables you to feed your pet remotely and check to see if Tabby or Rover is healthy and eating right
 A contextual infrastructure is being built to accommodate all these mundane but useful connected objects For example Belkins Conserve Surge Protector is a 30 device that looks like the any other surge protector you can buy in a supermarket But it comes with a remote switch that lets you simultaneously shut down six pluggedin devices eliminating the phantom power that often represents about 10 percent of your monthly electric bills 
 Tom Raftery who writes GreenMonk our favorite environmental blog told us about the Belkin WeMo short for We Movement which connects outlets motion sensors baby monitors and webcams by Wifi With WeMos mobile app you can switch your appliances on or off listen in on your baby and even check a webcam from anywhere to ensure an elderly relative is okay
 Raftery also pointed us to Belkins Echo Water Electricity and Natural Gas sensor devices due to come out in 2014 and 2015 They will be inconspicuous little attachments to home systems allowing homeowners to analyze and report on usage 
 The Eco Sensor WaterSaving Tap not to be confused with the Belkin Echo brand works like many faucets in public restrooms It is targeted to parents whose children forget to turn water off as well as people who have arthritis or cognitive issues such as Alzheimers 
 Philips is developing disposable sensors that can detect spoilage in your refrigerator or when its time to clean carpets towels or clothing
 GEs Grid IQ is an insight tool that mines social media for geotagged mentions of electrical outages allowing utility companies to respond faster Data is fed to hot maps where patterns alert crews and first responders to power outages floods tornadoes or fires
 Could such smart grids prevent such tragedies as the one caused by the massive forest fire that took the lives of 19 Arizona firefighters in June 2013 Perhaps not quite yet But they are coming closer all the time
 Robotic Household Assistants


 Another category of personal assistants for the home steps out of the pages of science fiction and perhaps meanders over the freaky line
 Robots have long existed as characters in books and movies More recently they have started taking over the most tedious jobs in automated factories and some of the most dangerous firstresponse work such as disarming explosive devices Now robots are finding roles in the home In some cases they are serving as novelty possessions for the affluent in Asia
 In India robot maids are used by some of the countrys uppercrust The Times of India a favorite publication of the nations elite alleged that it was because robots are less prone to tantrums than the humans they are replacing We suspect that its also because they dont mind the tantrums of their employers
 In Japan researchers are developing a household robot called AR for Assistant Robot With processing power and sensors sophisticated enough to see objects in 3D it can perform such complex chores such as ironing and dishwashing 
 Our relationship with our devices is going to emerge into something new and different in the coming Age of Context Talking with our mobile devices is one level but being greeted at the door by the family robot that takes your coat and fetches your slippers will bring a whole new dimension of service into our lives
 There has never been a place like the contextual home Our faucets and our thermostats will be sending us messages Our mobile apps will be sending suggestions to our smart mirrors But these will be useful messages messages sent by devices that understand what we need to know 
 It will be a direct and welcome contrast to the ubiquitous marketing messages we get every day that very often have nothing to do with our information needs location or activity
 We refer of course to the direct marketing and advertising industries
 

 Chapter 11 


 Pinpoint Marketing

 In the world of advertising theres no such thing as a lie Theres only the expedient exaggeration

 Roger Thornhill North by Northwest

 Sometimes marketing is like magic It can capture your dreams and take you to imaginary places Usually it is more like the sound of a cat fightintruding on your peace and leaving you frazzled Marketing and advertising deliver far more noise than signal Most of us it seems would just like it to go away But despite the mute and fastforward functions on our TVs and software filters the crap just keeps on coming
 Marketing was once about companies building relationships with customers and prospects branding was about building emotional attachments Now it seems its mostly about moneylots and lots of money We dont fault companies for wanting to make money We even do a little marketing ourselves to boost book sales 
 If there were a way to make marketing more relevant to our needs we would embrace the companies that send the messages We might even voluntarily become user champions spreading wordofmouth praise for the company and its products 
 We believe such changes will happen in the coming Age of Context when the smartest and most forwardthinking companies will send messages to their customers using the five forces The result will be lower marketing costs and dramatically higher response rates
 Context will allow us to receive messages based on location time of day season and what we intend to do next We believe this will dramatically boost response rates because customized messages will be more relevant to the recipients An ad for a discount at a nearby restaurant when we are hungry is pretty likely to get us to act immediately
 Unfortunately we cannot promise an immediate death of the stuff that sounds like a cat fight We think those annoyances will taper off slowly over the next decade or so We cant wait We will miss the noise of those untargeted messages as much as the colonoscopies that sensorembedded pills will replace
 As users we will have far greater control over who can send us messages We will be able to filter out the ones we do not want by topic source or moodofthemoment 
 The 2 Percent Intrusion


 If most people hate most marketing most of the time why are we all inundated with these ads Shel Israel learned the answer back in 1995 when he worked for a large PR agency and MCI a nowdefunct telecom company was his client The company pushed its discount phone service by having call center employees phone people at home at dinnertime
 Israel told his client that every time he mentioned MCI in conversations people became irate because they hated those intrusive calls The client confided he too had the same experience Sometimes it got so bad that he avoided disclosing who he worked for
 Israel asked him why he didnt drop the campaign The client stared at him in disbelief Are you crazy he asked We pull in a 2 percent national favorable response It grabs a 3 percent response in rural areas and urban minority areas
 What about the 98 percent of the people who hate you for calling Israel asked
 Screw em he replied Were getting rich off the 2 percent 
 Therein lies a statistical paradox At least 98 percent of all advertising or marketing messages are ignored or detested but a response rate of just 05 percent makes such efforts worthwhile and above a 2 percent response makes direct response campaigns profitable often extremely so
 So when someone sends out 10 million emails as is so often the case they dont really care that 9800000 people ignored or were annoyed by the intrusion 
 Direct marketers prefer getting that 2 percent on the internet rather than on radio or television because the costs are lower In fact the cost of direct online campaigns is so low that an unsavory marketer can send out 10 million emails for only 500 For a mere 69 she can buy a software bot from another online direct marketer that puts out tens of thousands of email messages in just a few seconds Response rates may be low for such crude efforts but they are high enough for marketers to keep sending them 
 Thus we get treated to all those offers to lose ten pounds in ten days or prosper by buying up foreclosed homes or earn a multimilliondollar commission by helping some Ethiopian heir launder money through our bank accounts Its that easy the marketer promises and it is that easyfor them
 Most people relegate such tripe to the spam bucket Google has begun to fight spam with contextual filters But as such tools emerged on email the bad guys found new points of attack such as Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Foursquare and other social networks 
 Its a Cold War The better our tools to evade direct marketing messages become the more new ways the marketers will find to intrude on our space
 False Context


 Youve probably heard of contextual advertising It started when Google introduced the AdSense network in 2003 When Googles web crawler began to scan tens of millions of pages of content matching ads to content by targeting keywords contextual advertising was born
 If you search for flights to Maui for example you might receive an ad for a nice deal on a place to stay However if after you returned you were looking up the name of the wonderful little shop you discovered upisland you might see the same offer In the former situation the ad is relevant in the latter its worthless
 Sometimes such ads are beneath worthless they are downright tasteless When tech author and journalist Steven Levy tweeted that a plane had crashed at San Francisco International Airport in June 2013 he reported that an Expedia ad suddenly appeared urging me to fly somewhere on vacation Such gaffes are far from uncommon and often leave a longlasting negative impression on the very people they are trying to attract
 Sometimes ads jump in at the right timebut they just dont know when to quit When Israel blogged that he wanted advice on buying a new refrigerator friends mentioned KitchenAid as a good choice and he almost immediately saw an ad for a closeout model at a great price Five years later the web pages he visited were still being peppered with ads for refrigerators dishwashers toaster ovens and sundry kitchen appliances before they finally trickled to a halt
 In short we disagree with Googles claim that their ads are contextual Their advertising system does not have an awareness of our personal patterns It has no sense of time it does not understand what we are doing or where we are doing it when it puts content in front of us
 The ad system cannot tell if we are hungry or cold thirsty or lonely It does not know our intent Marketing messages would be a lot better received if they could be targeted not to our eyeballs as they are today but to our intentions and our immediate environments as they increasingly will be in the Age of Context
 The Intention Economy


 Doc Searls coauthor of the groundbreaking Cluetrain Manifesto wrote a new book in 2012 The Intention EconomyWhen Customers Take Charge That book proposes to wrest marketplace controls from sellers and give them to buyers 
 When you want to go to Italy you would go to an internet space and declare your intention You would get offers from airlines hotels restaurants museums and places to visit Once you declare your choices all marketing bids would stop
  As Searls describes it the mechanism has many moving parts but we think if it were applied and refined over time the idea has merit
 A few companies already create online marketplaces where the buyer is in control Pricelinecom lets you post where you want to go and how much you are willing to pay and vendors compete for your travel dollars CrowdSPRING has created a similar graphic design marketplace 
 Searls we think may go too far in trying to give all the controls to the buyersa marketplace needs some giveandtake to operate optimally And todays sellers would benefit from employing less objectionable methods when they approach buyers
 We expect the Intention Economy to be a significant factor in how marketplaces will evolve in the new Contextual Ageand we expect that evolution to be rapid A second factor will be the ability for sellers to hyperpersonalize their offerings to each customer
 OnetoOne 


 For a few years in the 1950s Israels father Barney Israel was a doortodoor salesman a common profession during simpler times He knocked on strangers doors showing them samples of what he had to sell
 Sometimes a prospect wasnt interested in what he offered but voiced a desire for an item he didnt carry The senior Israel would search around and find the item returning later to sell it for a small markup He wasnt interested in the profit so much as making his customer loyal to him
 This is onetoone marketing in its simplest form The way Barney Israel practiced it was not very efficient and could not scale but it demonstrated the essential premise Understand what the customer wants and fulfill the need before someone else does Another way of looking at it Bring your business to the customer rather than make your customer come to you
 Bringing It Online


 In 1993 Don Peppers and Martha Rogers published The OneonOne Future which made the case for shifting marketing focus from product to customer It pioneered the idea of personalization in marketing 
 That revolutionary approach to marketing evolved into customer relationship management CRM a powerful method for building brand loyalty When it formed in 1999 salesforcecom based its CRM services entirely in the cloud and made that the differentiating factor against competitors It was wildly successful 
 As social media developed Salesforce leveraged it to more efficiently market to customers by actually engaging them in conversations This shift from message mongering as we called it in Naked Conversations to interactive conversations is called social CRM a phenomenon that has moved the enterprise closer to true contextual marketing Social CRM enables companies and customers to collaborate on products support policy and other issues
 Social CRM and online communities have done much to improve understanding and trust between companies and customers Most companies that use it assign an employee to help customers find what they want through their online communities Successful customer relationship managers never message monger on their employers behalf The companys customers analysts media investors and future employees become a wise crowd helping each other They do it faster and often with passion while the company saves on resources 
 Social CRM is Barney Israels style of onetoone marketingon steroids It enables global companies to use the internet to scale personalization by orders of magnitude These online communities create the sort of marketplace that Searls envisioned in at least one critical way The customers have to go somewhere and state what they want
 
 Our vision encompasses that but we think that marketing in the Age of Context can be so efficient that buyers wont need to go anywhere special or declare their intentions Sellers will be able to come to them when mobile social media sensors data and location technologies indicate that the customers are in the mood for a particular product or service 
 We call it Pinpoint Marketing
 Zeroing In


 Pinpoint Marketing is the ability of sellers to offer goods and services in the context of where you are and what you are doing and to anticipate what you want to do next Sellers can compete for your business by being more accurate in their predictions And marketers will know when to stop trying as your context changes
 Weve already given you examples of Pinpoint Marketing Remember the contextual beers at Gillette Stadium The Patriots use mobile technology to give customers what they want when they want it and they do it more easily than had been possible before 
 The Patriots know the patterns of their best customers and anticipate what they might want next They dont compete with the game by broadcasting messages to all 70000 fans but they do pinpoint a relatively small number of prime fans and are likely to get a very high response And the offers to selected fans remain invisible to anyone who could not take advantage of the deal anyway
 Pinpoint Marketing strategies reverse the traditional tenets of mass marketing Instead of spending more money to reach more people Pinpoint Marketing enables sellers to spend less money to reach fewer people but achieve a much higher response rate
 The Patriots program has just started and they did not reveal to us much about their longterm strategy but we have our own ideas about it For example we see a huge opportunity to upsell other stadium fans
  The Patriots will gather data on the patterns of their best customers this year They are learning what they order and when Many customers will order the same food at the same time
  Lets suppose its a cheesesteak and beer ordered by the phone app 15 minutes before the half picked up in the express line three minutes into the break But one week the Patriots send 50 to 100 of those select fans a special offer one hour before the break a 40 percent discount on a Pinot and a steak at a reserved table in the clubhouse 
 As the invited fans arrive in the dining area the staff recognizes them by their online photo addresses them by name and ushers them to a nice table where the Pinot is waiting and their hot and sizzling steaks are delivered just a moment later 
 As the lucky fans depart their tables are made ready for another 50 to 100 fans who have received similar offers for a clubhouse repast at a slightly later time slot Maybe half become regular clubhouse patrons The same goes on at other NFL stadiums and over time that makes a nice little incremental revenue boost
 But wait theres more as the guy on the latenight infomercial used to say On that same first Sunday someone in the long beer line for regular fans looks with envy at the express line and expresses envy on Facebook A few minutes later the Pats send that fan a message offering him a free pass and a discount to the express line the next time hes at Gillette Stadium
 Now the Patriots have started a supply chain of upgrading fans They increase loyalty and revenue Because they do it so efficiently the only cost to them is a discount on the newly anointed prime fans first meal or beverage
 As we mentioned in Chapter 3 on retailing such services are likely to spread to pro basketball baseball soccer hockey and wrestling venues as well as to concert halls theaters and racetracks In a while such programs will find their way to universitylevel events Theres really no stopping such programs once they take off
 Compare the marketing impact and effectiveness of such programs to a TV spot depicting a paunchy retired player inviting people to try the Gillette Clubhouse dining room at the next game or a cutout coupon in the Boston Phoenix Which would be most likely to make you a customer Which will make you more loyal to the organization 
 Pinpoint will not kill mass marketing but it will cause a little bruising that will never heal Slowly over time the new approach will grow and the old one will shrink At first traditional marketers will disdain Pinpoint as being only able to bring in pocket change Then they will become angry as Pinpoint distracts customers and siphons away revenue Then the traditional marketers will try to adapt but by then it will be too late
 The New OnetoOne 


 Many consumerfocused organizations separate their IT operations in functional silos and that creates significant barriers to successful Pinpoint Marketing Four separate internal IT systemsdining front desk golfactivities and meetingsat Robert Scobles beloved RitzCarlton dont talk to each other If you make dinner reservations the restaurant doesnt need to make you a special offer because you already intend to show up If you are a regular the matre d may offer you your favorite beverage as you are seated or bring you that chocolate souffl that you reviewed so favorably on Yelp after your last visit
 But if the four silos were open and connected sharing their data then the rest of the Ritz could offer you additional services The spa and golf courses could entice you to come a bit earlier The reservation desks could offer you a free postgolf changing room so you could see how great those rooms are Then they could tempt you to spend the night at halfprice in a room the Ritz knows will go unfilled anyway If from your room you see a little speck in the ocean from your window that could be a whale the Ritz might offer you a special deal with the local whalewatching excursion boat and for the outing perhaps a discounted windbreaker from one of their shops
 The hotel could personalize your visit in so many ways What starts with dinner reservations could be converted into a memorable time one that you may want to repeat and share with friends But IT systems have to talk to each other before this scenario will be possible and the hotel will need to leapfrog into the Age of Context by using mobile social media data sensors and location technologies to know their customers and prospects well enough to personalize services and offers
 What would motivate the Ritz to embark on a Pinpoint Marketing campaign such as this They already have a highly regarded brand and have survived recent economic tough times unscathed Our guess is they will be moved to change because a challenger will need to try such a new approach to compete with an entrenched market leader The Ritz will then have to follow suit or give a trailing competitor a chance to pull ahead
 Eliminating Sneaky 


 For many years online marketers have used a sly little piece of software known as a cookie to spy on you When you register on a site the vendor slips a cookie into your computer where it collects data on you and reports back to the vendor when you return to the site
 Cookies are not all bad They let the vendors site greet you by your name and remember your buying history The vendor knows how often you visit and what may have previously caused you to leave the site without purchasing anything
 Many users dont mind that level of personalization What they do mind is that cookies feel sneaky Most sites dont ask you before inserting a cookie on your computer Frequently the sites rarely read Terms of Use or Privacy Policy mention that by using the site you are granting it the right to put a cookie on your machine We guess thats because many users would say no if asked directly
 Personally we prefer vendors that show they respect the users right to choose Contextual technologies dont use cookies Most smartphone apps ask your permission to push messages at you and to know your location True many users dont yet understand the implications of these requests but at least there is some attempt to get permission before marketing to you 
 Users also have the right to turn off Notifications whenever they wish and doing so is a relatively simple task If you opt out you will be left alone but if you opt in you may find the messages you receive to be increasingly worthwhile 
 Glass Ad Empty


 So far weve mostly focused on marketing via phones and tablets where after a couple of years of trial and error companies like Facebook seem to be finally figuring out how to make mobile ads work
 Just as advertisers are catching up on the last generation of devices such as phones and tablets a new generation is coming in the form of wearable devices such as Google Glass the Pebble smart watch and even computerized socks 
 These spell trouble for advertisers because the new devices either have tiny screens or no screens at all 
 As of this writing Google has placed temporary advertising bans on Google Google Now and Google Glass But the worlds largest online ad platform is going to have to make money in the Age of Context somehow
 We think a new form of Pinpoint Marketing is the answer We also think it will be popular with users and even more lucrative for Google than ads have been
 The solution we envision will be in the form of micro commissions Google Glass will know not only where you are but whether you are driving on foot or riding a bicycle Understanding the context of your activity location the time of day and weather would greatly influence what you might want to do or buy next
 Lets walk through an example
 Its noon on a hot day in July a few years hence Glass sees you have been on a long bike ride and now you are resting in the shade of a tree You ask Glass to tell you where you can get a drink not currently a command and it tells you there is a mall a quarter of a mile away It suggests an organic shop that has iced fruit drinks When you enter the establishment Google receives a small percentage of the price of what you purchase Google earns a commission for delivering a customer
 Now lets return to that tree by the road Its midwinter and the temperature is slightly north of zero A snowmobiler puts his vehicle on idle and asks Glass where to get a drink This time Glass offers up a place in the same mall that serves hot chocolate and another offering beer and Irish coffee The intrepid snowmobiler makes a selection Google gets a tiny commission
 This makes marketing informational and very useful No ads are needed and stores are happy to pay a little bit for a real customer 
 Perhaps Google will get paid just for getting the cyclist and the snowmobiler to just take a look It has an old patent for technology that would enable a pay per gaze system which would of course make Google happier than the storesif Google opts to use that method In either case the user does not have to be bombarded with unwanted offers to visit the manicure salon in the same mall
 This same micro commission system could work on other devices In the future a Fitbit could detect from your blood sugar that you are hungry It could talk to a mobile device that knows the time of day your location and your food preferences Without you doing anything the mobile device suggests a few nearby places to eat You pick one and the vendors of both devices share a tiny commission
 Such payments may be small but eventually there could be billions of them every day When that happens advertisers and marketers that use massive message distribution to garner a microscopic percentage of advertising will provide too little value and will slowly vanish from marketing mix strategies
 Google is not alone One of its traditional rivals may be embarking on a similar microcommission strategy or at least it looks that way to us
 Micro Sales by Satori


 In Buddhism satori or enlightenment is the first step on the path toward nirvana It is also likely to be a big step toward the reemergence of Microsoft as a preeminent force in consumer technology
 Microsoft Satori is the result of many years of quiet internal rethinking at the Redmond giant Its aim is to help users of its devices and services find the right paint color for a room for example or understand the migration patterns of whales from the beach where they are watching them
 Satori takes Bings ability to crawl 10 trillion internet sites and integrates it with data from such significant partners as Facebook LinkedIn Twitter and Foursquare to build a digital copy of the physical world it will become a contextual engine driving all Microsoft and partner applications
 Satori is an extremely ambitious project Employing a massive amount of machine learning it is trying to recreate the entire physical world everything in it and the relationships among all those things
 So as you talk to a friend on a social network and mention you should get together for dinner a userauthorized Satoripowered system could find a night thats open to you both and suggest restaurants that you both like in convenient locations that wont be hard to reach based on traffic predictions for that night
 Once you select an option Satori would serve up competitive offers from nearby restaurants that might attempt to hijack your business
 Although Microsoft did not mention micro commissions when we talked with them this seems a very logical step toward a new form of revenue and as good a value proposition for Satori as it is for Glass
 Perhaps Microsoft plans to have a Glass of its own The company recently reorganized into a devices and services company We find it interesting that software seems relegated to a lesser role 
 The new organization makes Microsoft structure more like that of its archrivals Google and Apple Microsoft is clearly the underdog in the current landscape but Stefan Weitz argues that through its alliances and its own significant data stockpile Microsoft will understand more about realworld people places and things than any other company and Satori will be the most contextual data engine available
 
 Will Satori overcome the significant leads of its rivals That remains to be seen But we believe that users will benefit by having another significant player in the game and the one that offers end users the best and most relevant deals the most often may be the ultimate winner in what promises to be a lengthy battle
 Diverted Customers 


 Plus oneminus one is a sales and marketing term that refers to when you gain a customer that your competitor loses VinTank the California wine country startup that geofences wineries and other leisure destinations is an example of how context lets you implement plus oneminus one When one winerys premium customer drives past a competitors tasting room a welltimed offer can hijack that buyer just as Satori might do with competitive offers
 The same technology and tactics can be used in many ways For example if you intend to buy shoes at Nordstroms Bloomingdales sees your intent and may offer you a better deal on those red pumps you crave
 Tagwhat is a mobile app that lets vendors compete for your business as you walk jog or drive along giving you messages relevant to your activity your location and the time of day What we like best is Tagwhats noiseabating filtering system It lets you control what you see based on your mood or intent
 If you are strolling in a mall you can see what special offers are waiting for you inside each shop But if you prefer a little nightlife in nearby clubs you can filter out retail offers and display messages about which bands are playing and at what time Like other contextual apps Tagwhat will learn your taste over time 
 Those filters matter Without them it would be like walking through Times Square on a busy night with messages coming at you from every direction You would probably be overwhelmed and retreat to a less messageinfested neighborhood
 By tapping into Facebook and other social networking platforms Tagwhat lets you seeor perhaps hearwhat people you trust have to say helping you make decisions 
 Tagwhat is a young company It may be acquired before it has to decide how to monetize But if it has to choose we think that advertising would ruin the product just like we think it would hurt Glass
 We see the future for both companies in micro commissions We see micro commissions as a monetization system that could disrupt or destroy the most banal forms of marketing and we believe both buyers and sellers will benefit from their demise
 Dark Sides


 Wed love to be able to predict that contextual technology will usher in an era of such wonderment that unwanted messages will disappear and that all apps will be designed to increase user options Unfortunately not all contextual marketing will be designed with your desires in mind
 ThinkNear recently acquired by Telenav a turnbyturn direction vendor allows businesses to shoot ads at you when you get within 100 meters of them Filters are not included
 Scoble visited PARC Silicon Valleys oldest research center for a full day in August 2013 and saw several promising technologies One area is called contextual intelligence We saw similar technology earlier at SRI where researchers are using it to determine if troubled war veterans may be contemplating suicide by using contextual technology to determine mood 
 PARCs research team is working on using their version for more businessoriented purposes The system would use phone sensors to determine your mood and then feed that information to marketers and employers 
 PARCs focus is technology not application but as we thought about contextual intelligence we worried about how this new technology could be used without user permission or knowledge
 Could an employer track an employee after giving her a bad review to see if this darkened the employees mood or caused depression Can marketers make offers to you based on how you feel even when you have no intention of sharing such information
 Frankly we dont see how this can be prevented Such mood detection would follow a marketing tradition established back in the 1950s and documented by Vance Packards The Hidden Persuaders Packard wrote about how advertisers learned that the best way to sell a young man a red convertible was to show one with an attractive woman in the passenger seat
 Throughout this book weve referred to the balance between the benefits and dark sides of the Age of Context Perhaps the most complex controversial and sometimes volatile dark side is the issue of user privacy
 

 Chapter 12


 Why Trust Is The New Currency 

 You have zero privacy anyway Get over it

 Scott McNealy cofounder Sun Microsystems

 Up to this point we have extolled the virtues of new technology that can improve our homes health transportation communication work lives and the planet we live on Contextual technology is helping us explore outer space and the inner body We have spoken to hundreds of people and looked at hundreds of technologies and we firmly believe that adding context will make the world an easier more efficient cleaner and more productive place 
 However wed be negligent if we didnt point out that the price we pay for many of these benefits is our personal privacy Every new piece of technology we adopt requires us to consider that price and how it will be exacted We think it is imperative to know what the companies we deal with do with the data we are required to give them
 Loss of personal privacy had been going on for a long time before Scott McNealy made his observation In the early days of the home telephone party lines enabled your neighbors to listen in to your conversations without your knowledge Your social security number used to be a secret between you your employer and the federal government Now you need to share it to get a Comcast account Your credit card numbers are stored online where they are often shared between vendors without your knowledge When you clicked that button to consent to a Terms of Use Agreement you probably did not quite understand the implications hidden in the legalese 
 This chipping away of personal information accelerated when we moved online where our Facebook posts about a vacation can alert a burglar to an opportunity and photos of a loved one may attract a stalker In the Age of Context mobile and wearable devices keep track of our every motion even as we sleep and the rate at which our privacy is eroding grows exponentially 
 We did not fully understand the scope of the privacy issues people face when we started work on this book Our goal was to tell you about incredible new technologies that can understand you well enough to predict what you will need next and to automate many mundane tasks But with each chapter we found new privacy issues and some are too serious to brush aside
 While we were busy searching the world for mobile social media sensor data and location technologies the issues of government surveillance became a prominent national issue in the United States As the names Bradley Chelsea Manning Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev and Edward Snowden emerged from the headlines into the national consciousness public attention came to focus on the role of the secret FISA court the electronic surveillance of millions of Americans under a National Security Agency datamining operation called PRISM and so much more
 We are just a couple of tech enthusiasts and some of these national issues would normally go well beyond our purview were it not for the fact that the same technologies we are extolling are being used to secretly watch people Data about our searches social media interactions and even our cell phone conversations is being collected for purposes far different than we had imagined 
 Most people we talked with have strong feelings about this as we do But we are conflicted about a solution We want a safer country We want to be comfortable attending large gatherings such as the Boston Marathon We want small cells of conspirators to be detected and deterred before they can take diabolical actions 
 How much citizen privacy should be sacrificed in the name of national security We really do not know the answer What we have come to realize is that the conflict between security and privacy will not be easily or quickly resolved
 We do believe however that people would be far more comfortable if government were more transparent with the people they are supposed to serve For example Google wrote an open letter to Attorney General Eric Holder in June 2013 asking for permission to reveal how many of its user files had been subpoenaed under authority of the FISA court No answer was forthcoming as of this writing Daily revelations make us aware of more and more surveillance resulting in less and less trust
 It leaves people wondering Is big data watching us The answer is a resounding yes 
 We think the benefits we gain from contextual technology are worth the cost of the loss of some of our personal information 
 Not everyone will agree with us Where there is common ground is that the public needs to be more aware of what information is being collected and we deserve to know what will be done with that information 
 Even more important people should be allowed to opt out whenever they find that the privacy costs are just too high for their personal tastes And it should be easy to do
 We believe that greater transparency by businesses and government will lead to higher rates of customer and citizen participation 
 What bothers us is the sneaky stuff
 The Right to Go Silent


 Alwayson technology brings clear advantages It is convenient to have your personal contextual assistant see that it snowed while you slept and wake you up early so youll make it to work on time But shouldnt there be an easy way to take a break from the relentless eyes ears and data collectors that are part of life in the Age of Context
 Many contextual products already provide features that enable you to selectively keep some activities private For example NextGuide the contextual TV program location service lets you share what you watch and like with Facebook friendsor go private 
 We have mentioned many products that offer such controls but some of the most advanced products do not yet provide such options We believe that both Google Glass and the Moto X phone will be flagship products in the new Age of Context but both have features that concern us 
 Glass watches what you watch It has a sensor that records data on what you look at how often and for how long Moto X has a microphone that never turns off once you opt to enable it even when the phones power is turned off That arrangement allows you to conveniently issue voice searches through Google Now but it also means that the phone never stops listening Providing the ability to selectively opt out or go silent is essential to earning and keeping our trust 
 We call this the Las Vegas mode We would like to say to our Moto X OK Google Now for the next three hours do not capture anything about what we are doing
 Plain Speaking


 Millions of people use Fitbit Nike FuelBand and other devices to monitor every aspect of their bodily functions in an effort to become healthier 
 The unanswered question becomes who owns such potentially sensitive data Who gets to share it Some users we are told are so obsessed with counting every expended calorie that they even wear the device while making love Seems mildly amusing until we start wondering who owns that data and who has the right to share it Could it be used as evidence in a divorce case 
 Sensors meshed together in dissolvable tattoos are used on paralyzed patients today In the near future those sensors are likely to monitor all sorts of bodily functions Researchers are examining them as early detectors of cancers Sending such data directly to our doctors makes sense But do our insurance companies get to see it before we do How about our employers who often pay for most of the insurance Who gets to decide
 From our investigation it seems the issue of personal data ownership is murky and getting murkier Shel Israel has been a diabetic for many years jabbing his finger a few times every day to measure his blood sugar Every six months he brings his glucose meter to his endocrinologist who extracts and analyzes the data 
 His pharmacist recently informed him that a new California law requires him to share his data with them as well or his insurance coverage will be dropped raising the monthly cost from about 825 to about 165 Who is behind this law What is being done with medical data that is gathered at a local pharmacy and reviewed by state auditors Israel is reasonably sure that the states 37 million diabetics were not asked what they thought
 It seems selfevident that we should own our own data and that any thirdparty should need our permission to use it and our refusal should not trigger financially punitive measures
  The definition of privacy as the right to be left alone should apply to more than medical records It should apply to all data including our photos conversations and credit card balances But when we agree to those boring termsofuse agreements weoften unwittinglyyield to vendors the right to do with our private information whatever they wish When you post that photo of you celebrating a bit too much on Instagram opting to share it only with your friends Instagram claims it has the right to reuse itand it apparently doesbut in a free society shouldnt users be asked
 We also believe in the users right to plain language
 If we are going to voluntarily yield personal data then plain straightforward language should be used in the required optin agreements The repercussions should be spelled out and explained in great depth
  The loss of much of our privacy may be inevitable but the lack of transparency is something for which we can and should hold companies accountable 
 Pushing back on this point may get results faster and more easily than some people might think But over time we will remain the most loyal to the companies that earn our trust and do not betray it
 Human Override


 EasilyDo one of the personal contextual assistants we like uses a DoIt button that gives you an opportunity to override your software assistant before it performs tasks on your behalf Google Now the most popular PCA does not have the equivalent of a DoIt button We think Google Now needs one before we can trust it with our personal information
 We told you two of the most disturbing user privacy stories we found in Chapter 9 on PCAs First Dave Winer talked about picking up a female friend at the airport when Google Now warned him about her delayed flight connecting him to her flight information without any input on his part 
 Then Steve Brady related a similar story where Google Now presumed he was in a more advanced stage of a relationship with a woman he knew than was actually the case and the mobile app started sharing her private data as if they were committed partners
 For users to trust Google Now in the long run the danger of personal contextual assistants giving out privileged information must be far less than the threat of a human assistant doing so
 All personal contextual assistants should be designed to ask for permission and not make assumptions until a user pattern is well established and the owner specifically grants certain permissions that would remain in effect until cancelled Further they should provide a means for correcting inaccurate assumptions or information 
 No one wants a PCA that rats you out You cannot fire them the way you would an indiscreet employee but you can stop using them and stop trusting their manufacturer
 Privacy Is Subjective


 Privacy is complex fluid and granular How much of it we want depends on many variables Facebook used to let people respond to their relationship status as Its complicated We think the same option can be used for privacy 
 As parents we would be willing to yield a lot of our childrens location and personal data if it would ease their suffering from diabetes or asthma as we talked about in our chapter on Contextual Health 
 However we may not want a security sensor that can record data or movement in our bedrooms We may not mind Facebook electing to share a cute picture of our kid at a school concert but most people would not want photos of their children in front of their houses where addresses are visible posted in public spaces
 Such userempowering controls are not technically hard to accomplish As contextual technology pushes forward with relentless speed of development certain safeguards seem to be getting overlooked or bypassed
 For example if a college student posts a photo showing how he overcelebrated at a graduation party technology exists for an online service to display a popup dialogue box to ask Are you sure you want to post this This photo may be harmful to you in a job interview or when you ask your parents to subsidize your summer vacation
 Warnings about risks seem to have been brushed aside in recent times even though we are entering increasingly risky times In the Age of Context we seem to be unnecessarily performing risky tasks without a safety net
 Trust Is the New Currency


 We believe the most trustworthy companies will thrive in the Age of Context and those found to be short on candor will end up short on customers Transparency and trustworthiness will be the differentiating factors by which customers will make an increasing number of choices
 Most of the products we have examined in this book have one or more competitors already the remainder soon will Competitors will leapfrog each others capabilitieswhenever one product offers a desirable new feature the others will soon offer a similar or slightly better one
 In mobile phones iPhone had a clear functionality edge for a long time but as we write this Android has equaled or surpassed iPhones features Now Moto X has come along which may set a whole new standard because it has incorporated contextual functionality into its operating system
 The key point is that despite the volatile nature of the market many products will become commodities earlier in their development cycles than was the case with previous technologies For example we looked at about ten PCAs Each of those we highlighted had at least one unique feature but it seemed likely that competitors would be able to match them pretty easily People will probably choose just one PCA and stick with it even if one feature lags for a few months The same tendency for people to commit to one product and stick with it affects wearable devices and home management systems 
 If features arent the deciding factor how will we choose We think that most people will select the products made by the companies they trust the most The most transparent companiesthe ones that give the user privacy options they can understand and the option to turn apps and devices off and on as they see fitwill be deemed the most trustworthy Similarly companies whose products warn users before they do something that might embarrass them will be valued and trusted gaining the customers loyalty along the way 
 Today Google seems to have taken a leadership position in this area They have posted a single page where you can see the companys privacy policy as well as all the types of data it collects on users If you visit that page you may be surprised at how much Google knows about you Makes you wonder what data all the companies not posting similar pages have on you doesnt it
 Although Google may lead in this area today the previously mentioned serious and unresolved Glass and Moto X privacy issues are evidence that every company has at least one Achilles heel in the area of privacy
 If we were developing a longterm company strategy for the Contextual Age we would start by matching everything Google has done in transparency and then try to surpass it Users would certainly embrace such a competition 
 We think business leadership in the short term will require understanding that more is gained than lost by shining some sunlight on a few shady areas Some organizational decision makers have grown comfortable and have prospered in the shadows Some may opt to lurk there But thats not where their customers are comfortable And ultimately profitability lies in the customers comfort zone
 In our view the shadowlurkers may grab some sweet lowhanging fruit but in the long run they will lose to companies like Google and other transparent entities Openness and transparency create a significant opportunity for every startup that has giantkilling already etched into its organizational DNA If we are right then the Age of Context will give us an open new world 
 

 Epilogue


 Reunion 2038

 I never think of the futureit comes soon enough

 Albert Einstein

 Its 730 AM September 16 2038 when a little voice goes off inside Robert Scobles head He is sleeping blissfully in his Napa County home near his vineyards The comfortable twostory home was the only significant change he made in his lifestyle 25 years ago after Age of Context became a runaway best seller topping all charts and being read by over 2 million people in more than 50 countries 
 Sales had resulted in prosperity for Scoble and Shel Israel that neither had anticipated It didnt much change either of them Scoble kept traveling the world to interview technologists who pushed the envelope and Israel continued to write a lot and consult a little 
 Both of them now own cleanenergy highperformance cars that they could not previously afford Israel and his wife of 41 years Paula travel a bit more and Scoble uses some of his surprise wealth to acquire every new tech gadget that catches his fancy Both give regularly to worthy causes their favorite being charitywater
 Scobles eponymous Scobleizer Winery produces only a few hundred bottles each year enough for holiday gifts and many dinners with friends Inexpensive sensors and robots make tending the grapes easy and every October the Scobles throw a big harvest  stomp party Most of the attendees are young entrepreneurs intent on changing the world
 On this morning Scoble is dreaming about 2013 when the book first appeared how it got people and businesses to understand the promise of the new Age of Context even as it ignited a 25year debate over privacy and data ownership It is a fitting dream for the daythe 25th anniversary of Age of Contexts publication
  Good morning Robert says the voice in his head Today is September 16 It is 71 degrees Fahrenheit in your backyard and it is expected to rise to 83 at 300 PM You have only two appointments a call with Shel Israel at noon and an afternoon and dinner with Marc Benioff at the RitzCarlton in Half Moon Bay Traffic to the Ritz is clear all the way except for the usual tieups on the Golden Gate Bridge and Doyle Drive
 The voice was literally emanating from inside Scobles head A few weeks earlier he had become one of the first to beta test the new Google Everywhere visual computer The nearly microscopic device had been connected directly to his optic nerve enabling him to communicate not by oldfashioned gestures or voice commands but by brainwaves 
 Back in 2013 Salesforcecom founder and CEO Marc Benioff had mentioned brainwaves in his foreword to the book In 2013 using brainwaves to give machines commands was still in the experimental stage At MIT they got a robot to fetch a cup of coffee Braininteractive prosthetic limbs were just starting to operate effectively on a few pioneering volunteers A few years later technologists realized that brainwaves were the fastest way to interact with machines The greatest issue was getting people to focus when they send a mental command Machine learning still has trouble following humans whose minds tend to drift from the subject at hand
 Google Everywhere is the culmination of a 25year evolution from Google Glass now a museum artifact that kids laugh at because the device seems clumsy in design and severely limited in functionality
 Over the years digital eyewear became integrated into regular glasses with sensors embedded into the lenses A few years later the device became a set of contact lenses Many who needed no visual corrections adopted lenses just to be able to use the device Now digital eyewear is more popular than the old smartphones had ever been and far less expensive Most people on Earth had some form of digital eyewear with older models being sold for just a few dollars through Amazoncom or eBay
 Even in 2038 most people remain queasy about having microscopic devices installed inside their bodies Israel had already declared that the embedded opticals were several steps over his personal freaky line Some people are still a little retro Israel now on his 11th book still uses an oldfashioned keypad that attaches to his external eyewear through Wifi
 Several very large companies offer many digital eyewear choices in a wide range styles and prices and they evolved to become the central personal contextual assistants in most peoples lives They connect with other wearable devices and are powered by batteries that are often contained in clothing and charged automatically by Wifi They also connect with wristbands that monitor every possible bodily function
 The PCAs also are in constant contact with household sensors that monitor every imaginable environmental factor from pesky insects on the patio to excessive ozone radiation Because Scobles PCA is directly connected to his brain he can monitor every possible data bit whenever he wishesand filter them out when he does not
 But there is a tradeoff In the old days a privacy issue flashpoint had been that the old Google Glass monitored what people watched now Google Everywhere monitors what they think Although Glass came to know Scoble better than even his spouse Everywhere knows him better than he knows himself
 Even before Scoble rises on this fine September morning his optical PCA starts executing a series of commands in and around his home Outdoor windows reduce tint to let in warm sunshine while filtering out damaging rays Shower water starts heating precisely four minutes before the system expects him to step in His coffee maker begins brewing extrastrong precisely to his tastes
 As Scoble steps in the shower water automatically comes down at precisely the temperature and pressure he usually enjoys If it had been Maryam the water would be three degrees warmer If Scoble just thinks the water is too warm Everywhere reads the thought and signals the contextual shower to cool it just a bit
  As Scoble brushes his teeth Everywhere gets a message from his toothbrush that it is time for a cleaning After getting Scobles permission his optical device contacts his dentists office and compares schedules without any human involvement a good time slot is reserved
 His optical PCA has already shared his calendar and the weather with his smart closet mirror which offers Scoble a few good choices to wear to his reunion He picks a solid blue shirt as he so very often does
 Clothing looks similar to the styles of 25 years ago but these new garments are quite different For one thing they use nanotechnology to selfclean The fabrics weave opens and closes depending on weather and Scobles body temperature
 Scoble is now 74 and Israel has recently observed his 94th birthday Both are still going strong as are a great many people their age Doctors predict that most people living today will reach their 120th birthday although few have yet reached that age Lots of people plan to work at least until their 100th birthday including Scoble and IsraelContextual medicine which has evolved from a grassroots movement to be embraced by a majority of mainstream scientists technologists patients and doctors has managed to eliminate many of the diseases and environmental hazards that were prevalent back in 2013
 Thanks to contextual technology more people keep fitter than ever before Artificial limbs are almost impossible to distinguish from the body parts they replaced The oncecumbersome exoskeletons used by paraplegics in the old days have been refined so that they are now integrated into specialized apparel
 Taking It to the Ritz


 In his foreword Benioff who remains chairman of Salesforcecom had lamented how much better hotels could serve guest needs if they would just adopt contextual technology By odd coincidence he used almost the same words Scoble used a few chapters later when he pointed to the RitzCarlton near his old home in Half Moon Bay as an example of a businesss missed opportunity for upselling
 After the book came out the three became friends When Israel and Scoble decided in 2014 to meet for a first anniversary dinner the authors invited Benioff Scoble immediately suggested the Ritz in Half Moon Bay as the venue Theyve been returning there on the anniversary date ever since 
 This 2038 reunion is the first time that one of them would be absent Israel was visiting Armstrongville the first Mars settlementnamed for the first Earthling to walk on the moon Settling Mars was made possible when sensors on NASAs rover Curiosity II discovered steam vents on the red planet that led to an enormous underground fresh water oceanenough to sustain life and people When the smartdomed city was completed and populated by scientists and engineers in 2025 NASA called for 3000 civilian volunteers to settle the red planet More than 100000 signed up Monthly commercial flights had started just six months before Israel took off It was a grueling and expensive fiveday flight 
 Adventurous travelers had to sign up over a year in advance and then take the time slot they were assigned Israel was forced to skip the reunionhe was flying on a press pass and had to take the flight he was assigned to or wait a long time for another opportunity The trip fulfilled a lifetime dream His love for science and technology began when he read The Martian Chronicles as a schoolboy 
 Scoble took one last sip of coffee and sent a thought signal to have his robotic maid clear the dishes He took a last contented look at his ripening grapes and thought Okay Tesla Pick me up
 Seventyfive feet away a garage door rolled open and his silver Tesla Model X Gen 17 rolled up to his front door The car recognizing its owner unlocked the door and adjusted the seat
 He slid onto the seat Okay Tesla Take me to the Ritz he thought The engine hummed to life and the car rolled easily along back roads for a couple of miles and then south onto Highway 29 When it reached Highway 37 the Tesla turned west 
 As the car was keeping itself at precisely the speed limit Scoble had time to reflect Lately he was not turning on his social networks as frequently as he had when he was younger and the way billions of younger people constantly did He told Everywhere he wanted some soft jazz which poured out of the Teslas 16 surround sound speakers Over the years Scoble had come to agree with Israels oftenrepeated comment Sometimes always on is too much
 A few miles away Benioff had enjoyed a similar morning He too was enjoying an automatic ride to Half Moon Bay
 As scheduled Benioff Scoble and Israel joined in a holographic conference call Each saw images of the other two standing in front of them They talked about old times and outer space They talked about grandchildren and pets Reception wasnt bad considering that 35 million miles of outer space separated Israel from his old friends
 A short while later the two cars arrive almost simultaneously at the Ritz delivering their passengers to the main entrance and then parking themselves in the guest lot As the two friends enter the lobby they are welcomed by name and wished a hearty congratulations on the anniversary of the books publication 
 Scoble and Benioff enter the Navio Restaurant and are seated at their usual table where two glasses of 25yearold Oban Whiskey are waiting for them 
 They toast the book They toast each other They toast Israel and they toast the Ritz for finally getting context right
 Parting Thought


 This chapter is of course a little flight of fantasy Many of our predictions here probably will not happen But many will We just dont know which will be which 
 We have written Age of Context with excitement and with pain We are excited because contextual technology can solve so many of the worlds problems We are pained by the damage that abuse could cause
 At the end of the day the technology has always been and always will be just a set of tools for people to use or abuse as they see fit We can gush about the virtues or agonize about the dangers until we turn purple
 What the Age of Context will look like 25 years from now is really up to us
 

 Acknowledgments

 It took a global village to write this book We are great believers in crowdsourcing and in the 16 months we spent researching writing designing and producing Age of Context more than a thousand people have helped us in ways large and small
 We are grateful to the dynamics of online conversations where people from more than a dozen countries commented contributed criticized corrected and encouraged us through Facebook Google Twitter and email They were the sources of many new ideas and content that was included in this work They corrected facts and focused observations
 Thank you crowd You helped us write a better book As we enter a period where an increasing number of authors will selfpublish as we have done the voluntary resources available to you are an asset not to be underestimated Most authors just use social media as a promotional tool and it is useful in that way but it is far more powerful as a conversational tool which is how we have used it
 Many individuals deserve mention as well First there are our mentors professionals who have successfully blazed the trail we have followed
 Guy Kawasaki and Shawn Welch of APE Author Publisher Entrepreneur  How to Publish a Book wrote the guidebook to how selfpublishing should be done Guy met with us and convinced us that this was the right course with us Shawn did the internal design for Age of Context shared both contacts and technical expertise that have proven invaluable
 Rick Smolan who is coauthor with Jennifer Erwitt of numerous popular and breathtaking photobooks including The Human Voice of Big Data Rick was the first to turn to the private sector to underwrite book projects without sacrificing editorial credibility 
 Without the sponsorship of Rackspace EasilyDo Betaworks Autodesk Microsoft and Mindsmack this book would not have been possible Their generosity allowed Shel Israel to work full time on this project and to bring in a toplevel team that has contributed far more than the authors had the right to expect
 Harry Miller former editor of PC World added unbelievable insight and wisdom He kept the authors on track and set a very high bar for accuracy and balance He managed the editorial process and assembled a firstrate editorial team of Tema Goodwin our copy editor Rick Ladd proofreader and Nicholas DeLuca our fact checker
 Shonali Burke has run our marketing and PR launch efforts serving as the glue that holds together two authors who tend to simultaneously run out of control in divergent directions She put together our incredibly successful launch party at the amazing Hiller Aviation Museum and managed our crammed speaking and media engagement schedule She executed flawlessly and exhibited intelligence patience and integrity at every step
 Nico Nicomedes our cover designer found us on Facebook when we were floundering with several cover design attempts that the Facebook crowd n its infinite wisdom had rejected He was one of several people who voluntarily sent us rough cover designs all of which were better than our selections We liked Nicos because it was bold memorable and reflected what we felt the book was about He was fast and extremely easy to work with 
 Paula Israel conducted the wife test for this book as she has done for Shels previous writings Her job was to ensure that the language and content was interesting and useful to people outside of tech inner circles In short she made the book useful to more people 
 We thank all these people for their generosity And finally we thank each of you who have now read our book for your time interest and support
